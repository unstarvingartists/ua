- Hey everybody, Harry Whelchel here. Today I have Bryce Tubbs. We're gonna be talking about how Bryce went from 2K a month to 15,000 a month in sales in less than three months, about two and a half months.

- When I first came to you it was, the there was a couple problems but the main one was about lead generation. Specifically I was like, "You know, LinkedIn's not delivering me enough sales calls fast enough for my consulting. So maybe I should try Facebook." I first saw you in this group a long time ago but it didn't really click at all. I saw you again, there was this guy who's kind of a rival for me. It was just that if that guy can do it and you're the one who helped that guy out, let's hop on the phone call and see what's up? Yeah. I think you call it like a creating leads. And it's really cool to be able to do it because, before I was scared I was gonna run out of leads. That was my biggest thing. But now it's like any person who's in the accounting space or a bookkeeper or even the entire world, if I can teach them how to do the stuff, is like someone I can go and get to pay me. So before, I was actually scared to ask for interviews and testimonials and stuff, because I guess I hadn't really put it into perspective what my course and my program was about. So we were talking on one of our calls and you were like, "Just ask the person." And I asked the first person she said, "Absolutely, yes." So now anytime somebody gets a result, I just say, "Hey, let's hop on a call and let's do a testimonial." So now I got about six new ones in the past two weeks. Pretty helpful to have those tools. I give my clients better results now. So that's the main one. And yeah, my closure rate right now is at 40%. So that's pretty good. The main thing is just the sales aspect. Because if you're like a consultant, part of your results come from both your ability to sell and then your ability to be able to teach other people to sell too. That right there is like the main reason why you should buy a course like this, is because of that sales training. And learning how to have an end-to-end sales process, is what it's called. That's key. Chances are if you're listening, you probably don't know how to get to the next level. So I mean, it's one of those things like you rather want to get to the next level or you might... You just don't. So it's like take the jump, trust that when you jump it's gonna be the right thing and your money's gonna come back to you. It's just one of those things hard to explain.
