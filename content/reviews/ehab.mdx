- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here, Today I have Ehab Omaro And we're gonna be talking about how Ehab sold three of his art pieces in the last month for about 1,000 euros.

- I made like for approx for, approx of 3,000 euros.

- Yeah.

- And it was, and it was like the fir, I would say it was like the first three sales to me. I made it this way, like I approach.

- So how does it feel?

- It feels great. I feel, it feels like I, I have my, my destiny in my hand, so I can, I can decide what, what what I do and, and I can make things work or not. It depends how much I work. I've been working a lot and trying many different technique but none of them was working. And everyone told me like you really need a coach, you need you need someone to understand this side of business because I wasn't too eager to say, like I don't know how to do it because, but I really don't know how to do it because I know how to paint but I didn't know how to make a sales. I didn't know how to, to make a business to run my own business. I think every artist has this issue with, with its mind. It's more like a mindset, no matter how creative you are no matter how good are you doing, mixing color doing realistic or any kind of art you're doing. It's more about your mindset and about to be to be mentored by someone who really in the business and know how things are done. If you wanna really make a living from from what you are really passionate about you need to take action. I would say. You are really not going to regret it. And it could be like, yeah, for me, I would say it was like one of the best decision I have ever made because it's changed my life in a huge way, I would say. So I would really recommend, and you got nothing to lose. You got a lot to win. It's a life changing. I mean, I've never thought I would have a way to do it. I, I've never thought I could make a living out of it. So it's really great things to do.
