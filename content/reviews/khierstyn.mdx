- 3, 2, 1, hey everybody, Harry Whelchel here, today I have Khierstyn Ross from khierstyn.com. We're gonna be talking about how Khierstyn went from about a little less than 10,000 a month really in the midst of quarantine down at that time, recovering back up to 28,500 in about 60 days. All right, so Khierstyn, why don't I turn it over to you? Can you just introduce yourself and tell people a little bit more about you and what you do?

- Yeah. So, hey guys, anyone watching this, I'm like the queen of product launches, so I've been called, I help people launch products using Kickstarter and Indiegogo as a way to get orders for new products that they then go and manufacture and deliver. So really like I'm a specialist in e-commerce, specifically crowdfunding, so yeah, I'm stoked to be here.

- Amazing. That's awesome, okay, cool. So how long have you been.

- Yeah.

- In the product launch, Indiegogo, Kickstarter, E-commerce space?

- Yeah, man, I've been in the space for about five years now, so yeah, pretty full-time for about five years.

- Cool. And.

- Yeah.

- How did you first get into it?

- So I first got into it through a failure actually. I kind of joke around that crowdfunding found me because like my very first campaign at the time, I was still trying to find my ways I consultant, I was paranoid of niching down because I really was convinced that if I specialized, I would be saying no to all this business, when in reality, me not being able to say no and keeping that open mind and not specializing was the thing that was stopping me from growing. And so at the time it worked in my favor though, because I met a guy at a networking event who had this cool product idea, and he's like, yeah, I wanna do this like crowd funding campaign. And I'm like, I don't know what that is, but sure. Eventually we became friends, we partnered up and a few months later ended up launching this thing on Indiegogo. We made every mistake in the book, but after that happened, that first launch was an epic failure, like through crowdfunding launches, you need to set a specific goal and if you don't hit that funding goal, then no money changes hands, you don't get the money. And for us, we set a goal of 50,000 and ended up raising only 17,000. And so of course we couldn't do anything with the money at that point, and it was a epic public humiliation. So we thought at first, man, no one wants this product. Should we just give up? But then after speaking to some people in the industry, they're like, no, the product is gold, your execution of the strategy was terrible. And we're like, okay, maybe there's something to this. So if we are going to relaunch, what has to happen for this to be a success? So we actually took it seriously changed a lot and ended up relaunching three months later. And that product went from a $17,000 failure to one that did $600,000 in pre-orders.

- Wow.

- With close to 5,000 customers. And.

- What was the product.

- Like. It no longer exists because it ended up being like a huge scam, unfortunately.

- Oh.

- But it's a vest that helps you lose weight through cold temperatures. Hmm, okay, interesting.

- Yeah, yeah. Like, so the science was there, but like, this is the classic case of a crowdfunding campaign gone bad because five years ago, it was okay to raise money for an idea. And at the time we were still waiting for the green light from the engineering firm that this kind of technology was in fact possible. So we're like, all right, because we need to go for investment, we're just gonna do this big crowd funding campaign. And it took off and it ended up that the tech behind the product wasn't actually possible. So the final product was like delivered nothing as what was promised. And so this is not my product, I was purely the marketing person and I no longer speak to the founder but there's so much to be learned from that, that first like horror story. And they say that if you aren't embarrassed by your first project, you're not doing it right. So, I now like to share the story to show kind of like the dark side to product launches, because I think that it's.

- Hmm-mm.

- Really crafted the, how I teach it and what I promote now with like what not to do, how to run a legitimate business, how to make sure you're honest with your customers. And so I'm like super thankful for what happened with that, because not only did that, like gain a lot of interest from the local Toronto community to like for me to go and speak on what, like how we did that, but that landed me my next few launches. And those next launches were great, products are still around today, they did about $350,000. And my next like five or six launches did nothing less than six figures. And so that was really the time, that and a good friend telling me, like, you have to niche down, you have to get specific. Everything has to be about Kickstarter, that's when things just really started to take off for me. With that.

- So interesting. Yeah, so it's like, I mean.

- Yeah.

- It's probably better to have that experience earlier in your career, learn from it, and then like.

- Yeah.

- Like you said, apply the positive sides 'cause it sounded like you learned a ton.

- Oh my gosh, there was so much.

- And you can now bring all that to your clients if that makes sense.

- Yeah. Yeah, and it's funny 'cause like you and I, when we first started recording this, I was like, man, I feel embarrassed about my revenue because you hear the story and how I've raised millions with our clients, but how are we only doing 10K a month? So I do wanna preface that, launches are a little different to e-commerce because right around the time that Corona hit, like nearly 75% of our clients were like, whoa, put on the brakes. Like we can't invest the money in a product launch just yet until we know that things are like okay with the market.

- They probably didn't do any like product development, manufacturing, shipping, everything was just like, no one knew what was going on.

- Everything stopped. Yeah. And we did have, some of our clients in industries that were like booming like masks or baby products, like they were, they stuck with us, which is great. But I think one thing when you coming into the equation was really great because quarantine, I think a lot of people can resonate with this really forces you to look at the ugly of your business and what you really wanna be doing and how you really wanna be doing it. And so coming in with you, it's been kind of a messy trajectory because it's been a lot of figuring out like what the product is, what the offer is. But I know that, me starting to work with a sales coach, forced me to look at that side of the business, and that's the big reason why we were able to really literally do a 360 in the business in such a short period of time and like, and rebound with it, right?

- Yes. And I wanna dig into that more, but let me just ask you one other question before you get into that, like, kind of what do you think makes you guys unique in terms of the product launch space?

- Yeah, so what makes us unique in, it's me first off, like I'm designing a personal brand around this, which can mean whatever it means, but the reason why people choose to work with us on the agency side is because we're not some $20 million a year agency that where people literally feel like they're put into a cookie cutter solution. We are bespoke, we work really closely with our clients. I don't take on more than I can personally oversee because that's what gets us the results we get, is like my personal investment into agency side. So there's that, 'cause I know I don't wanna grow a massive agency and be totally disconnected from launches. But the other side of what makes us unique is the product launch pad offer that we have. Right now in our industry, there's only either you could choose from Udemy courses that are $200, which are completely out of date with no mentorship, no coaching, or you can pay agency sides like 20 grand to run your launch. And there's no middle ground, the middle ground of, okay, what if you can get that mentorship and that program that doesn't break the bank. And it caters to people that are majority of the Kickstarter population, which is they wanna do less than a six-figure launch. Can you provide something that isn't gonna break the bank, but still gets the job done, gets them the recipe, gets them the mentorship. And I think that it's the offer that we have, that we're working on how to really scale that up, it's that offer that makes us completely unique to the marketplace.

- I get it, hat makes a ton of sense. It's like, I bet there's a fair number of folks who, maybe they've had a launch or two under their belt, but it's still like you said, it's like, they wanna make six figures, less than six figures on that first launch to validate things with Kickstarter. So their needs are gonna be unique, and it's like, they probably can't hire like a big agency, but they also want more help than just like a couple of slides on Udemy that probably aren't even that good or accurate or anything like that.

- It's not, yeah, like I've never actually bought a Udemy course, but I can imagine what you get for $200. Like it's out of date.

- You pay for what you get, right.

- No mentorship. Yeah, exactly. And like, I'm a huge believer in hiring coaches. Like you pay for experience that will help fast track your results. Assuming you actually apply it and take action, right? Like that's the caveat, it's not like, oh, hire Harry and everything's gonna take off, yeah, but you got to put in the work. But for the people that put in the work have access to the feedback, have access to the community and the mentorship, like there's nothing like it. And I find that that's really, I don't know, I just feel like the market that I serve is being underserved because so many people focus on scaling your e-commerce business, but when it comes to how to build that initial audience, like that's a very, very underserved demographic.

- Yeah.

- And unfortunately you need the audience, you need to be able to sell something before you build it, otherwise you're in for a lot of hurt.

- Yeah.

- So.

- No, that makes sense. So let's go back to maybe like the weeks before we were working together, like, what were you doing, what was on your mind in those weeks before we were working together?

- Denial of quarantine, number one, number two, I was like, consistency has been my biggest weakness in my business because I will, everyone says you need to do outreach, but no one tells you how shitty it is, but it's not that it's shitty, it's that you don't have the right system to do it, but not only that, your follow through is terrible. Like, so I'm not saying me, like I was super inconsistent with outreach and the direct marketing activities that I needed to be doing to consistently be having, have deal flow coming in, right. It was constantly a feast and famine mode of like, I'd spent two months going hard on marketing and then six weeks kind of buried with client work that I would stop that. And so I think that before you, I was kind of all over the place figuring out what the offer is, why it would sell, how we should market and why does it work? And I was very like reactive with stuff. Is this making sense?

- Hmm-mm. Yeah.

- Right.

- Was there like a particular you were trying to tackle that like made you like start looking around for something? Or was it just, was it the lead gen piece? Was it something else?

- It's a bit of both. Like, I think in the back of my mind, I always knew that I just felt like there's a disconnect between how are we so good at what we do and get really awesome results, and I'm an influencer in the space, why is it so hard to sell? Right. And it's not, like I just felt like it should be a lot easier, it should be a lot easier to market. And maybe that was like a flawed expectation setting on my end, but I knew when you and I connected in the back of my mind, I was like, man, if someone could just like dive into my sales process and help me make sense of this and that's where you came in. So it's a mix of, I needed help with the sales process to figure, just to help me commit to what the offers are and not change my mind every five seconds, to get super clear on that, but also how to, you also were really good at, I don't know if it's your system or whatever, but you were just so, the way that you approach organic marketing made me realize that maybe this doesn't have to be so shitty, maybe this can be fun and maybe this is something that I can do, so you actually helped me make sense of that. And that's where I've been able to become pretty consistent with the actual marketing side and really focusing on that side of the business. So it's both, it's a bit processing, it's getting super clear on that and the offers and also having the daily practice of going out and focusing on marketing activities, because those two things, when your business makes sense to you and you're actively and being consistent with your marketing efforts, that's when consistent lead flow comes in, that's when consistent deal flow comes in. When revenue comes in, when revenue comes in, that's when you can invest in a team, that's when you can start to leverage yourself, that's when things get really fun.

- So I think.

- Khierstyn, like going back to like, so you knew you needed to work on your sales process, your lead gen, like, was that frustrating at the time, like the ambiguity around that? Tell me a bit about that.

- Well, yeah, 'cause I, like organic marketing. I've never liked it because it's not predictable. I don't know how much of that is other gurus telling you that you got to get your sales funnel working with ads, right, but I just, I was conflicted between okay, my ad funnel is not converting the way we want it to, but that was an issue with the offer, core problem, right. We're not getting consistent deal flow so you got to focus on ads. And I think, sorry, I don't know what the question was, but ultimately it comes down to, you just helped flip the script for me, that organic advertising can actually be the best kind of marketing and got me into a system that actually works for me.

- Yeah. I mean, I think the way I would say it, and this is not, I don't know if you agree with this, but like the, yeah, if you get good at your offer structure, your sales process, your copywriting, ads are easier than organic, period.

- Yes.

- I'll say it like it is.

- Yeah, yeah.

- But if, if you don't have those things all humming, then ads is random and it may work, it may not. And it's like, a lot of people think.

- But it's burning cash.

- It's less labor intensive, it's easier, but they haven't kind of built the basics as well as they need to to benefit from the ease of the channel. If that makes sense.

- Yeah. Because before you, where I was at is I was convinced I'm gonna make YouTube work, or first it was Facebook. I'm gonna make Facebook work, and again, my offer was all over the place, of course I burned through a couple grand, got kicked off Facebook. They've just, you know.

- How did that feel?

- And then I was like going to use YouTube ads.

- Was that annoying?

- Oh my gosh. Yeah, Because I don't, I wrote one line of copy that when a human looked at it, they're like, oh, that's innocent, and their algorithm freaked out and banned me and now anytime I go to post anything, they're like, oh, your ads approved, and then a day later, oh no, you're you're suspended. And then I'll get their customer service rep on the phone, appeal days on end, and they're like, ma'am, there's nothing wrong with your account, your copy was fine. It was probably just a glitch in the system. And like, so five times later it's like the same story. So I'm like, Facebook.

- So that's not good, so then you went to YouTube.

- So I went to YouTube, and YouTube, the quality of leads, amazing. But again, my offer and my sales process were off so of course any money spent there was just like, there's no good data and feedback coming back. But I was convinced that, all right, I have to invest like five grand in ads this month and I'll get the funnel working. But ultimately it comes down to, if you don't have your foundations right, and I knew this and I teach this, but of course it's like, but you don't get your foundations right, ads are burning money. So starting to work with you and committing to our organic system is what we're doing. So that's my plan now is we are getting the organic side humming, that's like posting us for podcast interviews, that's getting into Facebook groups, that's focusing on YouTube videos. It's just like, it's getting out there, right, so that we have consistent deal flow coming in and a great healthy foundational presence. And then we're gonna turn on the ads.

- Awesome. Well, cool.

- Yeah,

- So where did you first hear about me?

- I was freaking out one day and post, and I realized that Facebook had, 'cause we do manage Facebook ads for clients, so in the heat of client work, the day that campaign budget optimization became a like mandatory thing on Facebook. I was posting in a Facebook group being like, guys, how do we do CBO for physical products or whatever? And you replied and then you were just so helpful. And then I went to your profile and I was like, ah, he knows how to sell stuff. And he seems really nice, maybe we should be friends. And then we hit it off as friends on chat, I was like, you're my kind of person, but then the first call, I didn't know if it was like a networking call or a sales call, but I just kind of went with it because you weren't trying to sell anything, you're just like, let's just talk, and I'm like, I need help because I'm really struggling. And you're like, well, I help people sell things, and I'm like, oh, okay. So here we are.

- All right.

- Here we are.

- That's awesome. So was there anything in particular that peaked your interest in those interactions?

- You were just genuinely curious, you weren't, you held high status, so you weren't like every other person online who's like, oh, I can help you with that, let's book a call. Right, you were just like, you were trying to understand the business and ultimately give good feedback. Like of course you had a hidden agenda, but you were more like, is there synergy with us as humans? If so, we'll just see where it naturally goes, as opposed to, I'm just gonna try and sell you my website services or something, right.

- Cool. Cool, got it.

- Yeah.

- I appreciate that, yeah. So when we started working together, like maybe can you speak to like one, two, maybe three things like, two or three things at a high level that you've felt were like really impactful and you're getting those results you've gotten in the last 60 days.

- Well, having access to someone I can actually talk through my sales process with, and my offer in a different niche who's never worked with me before and have them pick it apart or see it in a different light was very useful for one, because I realized quickly how muddled my messaging was and how I had no proven sales process. Like I was working off an old script that did not feel right to me, it was just like, I was replicating someone else's script and then to try and customize it for me. And so I just felt like working with you, being able to talk through that with you gave me confidence in not only the sales structure, but also the offer structure and be able to present it in a way to people that is actually, sits right with me a lot, because in what I do, there's a lot of expectations management with people, I can't just be like, yeah, work with me and we're gonna make you so much money. Like there's a heavy upfront investment of time and resources and so people have to be taken through a specific sequence to do that. So a, I think the confidence and the clarity I got by just being able to bounce it off someone. Secondly, you were, you made the organic side of things and like doing outreach and Facebook groups be value focused and feel good as opposed to spamming. So that was a big thing. And also just having access to the group and having money go out the door to pay a consultant like you to help me focus on the sales pro, it's like hiring a personal trainer, you ignore it until you're forced to go to the gym, right. And so I think just having access to the group and the accountability and the system all around forced me to focus on the things I needed to focus on.

- It's been really cool to see you did that accountability initiative like around organic in the group.

- Yeah.

- Can you speak to that just briefly?

- I needed that. I needed to do that, so I would actually do it,

- Yeah, and it seems like people are liking it.

- Yeah, well, I look bad if I don't follow through and I haven't posted in a few days, but I'm doing the accountability thing. I'm doing it, but I just, if I commit to something and don't follow through, it makes me look bad. So because of that psychology, I'm like, right, what do I really not want to do? I really don't wanna do 30 days of outreach, so let's go do it. So, but I think you understand how.

- And with the outreach, like, so you've been seeing, I remember, like we know we started in it, we worked on it, we workshoped stuff you were doing, and you've seen an improvement, you're seeing, generating leads.

- Hmm.

- And things from it.

- Yeah. I am like, 'cause people, I've like tangibly booked about seven grand from the three hours of outreach I've done in the last two weeks, which is massive, but I feel like it's easy-ish for me, but I just start chatting people up in fate, in Kickstarter specific, Facebook groups, and they go to my YouTube channel, they're like, oh, she's legit, okay. So I feel that I don't have to reach out to people in the group, I don't need to friend people. I probably should be, but people are coming to me a lot more frequently because they're like, hey, you said something really smart there , like I think you know what you're doing. So definitely generating, and even if about outreach, that date, like you're legitimately helping make people's lives better and their businesses better. So I think even just from a karma standpoint, like that's good time spent in these groups.

- Have you seen anybody yet like where you maybe help them weeks ago when they reach out to you weeks later? Has that happened yet to you in some of these groups?

- Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah. Maybe not even the groups with people. I don't even, I'm sure that that happens for sure. I'm gonna say yes, it has, because I will talk to some people and they're like, hey, I saw your posts, they have an upcoming product. And then we get on a QC, a quick chat. And they're like, it's idea phase I won't have a prototype for two months, and I'm like, oh, okay. We're a little too early, come back to me. And they do usually.

- Nice.

- So.

- Nice.

- Yeah.

- So are there any like tangible, maybe like a win or two that you can share in the last 60 days?

- Yeah.

- Any interesting like sales wins or calls that ended up landing that you didn't think you would, or just any interesting kind of anecdotes from, in the last few months?

- Well. Yeah, the first thing when I started working with you, there was like an emphasis on, okay, how can we charge more? Okay. So I doubled my agency prices and literally within a week of doing that, I booked three agency clients at that price for 90 day sprints. So like out of that, I booked about $70,000 worth of projects from going up and saying, no, our new base has doubled now. And this is what we can do because I realized you can sell more value when your prices are higher, because you can do more with what's in that price. Right. So that's been, that's really, really good, and that happened like pretty much, yeah, within a week or two of just committing to those higher prices on the agency side. So that's like tangible win, but also I've like finally figured out the two offers that I am running with, and I finally feel confident about them and I don't, I'm not like going back and forth trying to like figure out like what the client wants. Like, no, these are the packages we have, and this is what we're running with for that. So I feel very, very confident with getting that clarity in that process, as well as like our launchpad offer and how to open that up past Kickstarter people and more to a generic like product launch.

- Cool. Yeah, and like.

- So yeah.

- I mean more broadly, like how did it feel last month to do like a little under 30K? I'm sure that's nice.

- Pretty good. Well, yeah, in my affirmations every day, like my next big milestone was 24,000 just climbing back after quarantine and it took me a couple months, but like we did it, so it was nice to shoot past that.

- That's awesome, that's awesome.

- Yeah.

- That's so cool.

- I definitely bought myself an iPad, 'cause I'm like, you know what? Good month, you deserve it.

- That's awesome. So what's like next for you in the next month or two?

- Yeah, so the team and I are focused on getting regular habits around specific organic targets. So there's that, just making sure we now have LinkedIn outreach going, all those foundations and then we are, I'm going back cautiously to ads to look to scale that.

- Nice.

- As well with the new offers and the clarity that I've had last couple of months.

- That'll be exciting.

- Yeah, it will be, hey.

- Cool, cool.

- So.

- Well, let me see. So looking back, like back to our sales conversation, why did you decide to do business with me?

- Because I knew this was an area of the business I was ignoring and I knew it was an area I really needed help and accountability in. And I felt really uncomfortable when I was, in a good way when you're like, so what's holding you back, whatever it is that you do on your call, and I was like, honestly, I'm not putting in the work consistently, I need to, and I'm just, I was really like, I was just feeling stuck on the sales side and I needed that extra perspective to help get me unstuck and get to that next level. So I think I just, I had a good feeling and you made it such a no-brainer at the time, you're like, because you had, I guess, flexible terms at that point, and I was like, let's just try it for a bit, and it, within the first few days I knew it was a good investment, so.

- Awesome, so what.

- Yeah.

- Was there anything in particular that kind of kicked you over the fence? What do you mean? Like, of a yes.

- I mean, I'm trying to remember back, like, I don't think there was, like I think, I think I shared the pricing and terms and stuff, and you were just like, you said yes I think maybe right away. Do you remember if you hemmed in hot? I don't think you did.

- No, I'm not that person, like I'm either a hell yes or a hell no. And I think going into the call, I knew, I just like I had a number that if you'd quoted me, it was over, I would have had to think about it, but it wasn't that I just, I don't know, like I feel that you have to be decisive with things like this that you just know you need. So, and frankly, I looked at it and I was like, okay, what are the odds I work with them for a month and we don't get ROI, like very, very, very low, unless if I literally do nothing. So do you trust yourself to work with him for 30 days, 60 whatever, and see if this works? And it was just like, yeah, if I work with him, I'm gonna kick myself if I spend this money and don't take action. So yes, it's a solid investment.

- Nice,

- I can just, this is what I think.

- Nice.

- So. I don't like dwelling on decisions.

- That's a good thing, and like, I mean, there's some areas of my life where like, I'm really good at making it such as quickly and others I need to keep working on, but it's, that's good that you're able to just like pull the trigger and give that a go.

- Yeah.

- So like, it might be silly to ask this, but like would you recommend others work with me?

- Yeah, no, you're terrible. Of course. Sorry guys, that was sarcasm, yes, I love Harry, that's why I agreed to do this.

- Yeah, so who do you think.

- So.

- Like who do you think in particular is a good fit for me?

- I think that if someone is just considering being a consultant and they don't have their niche figured out and they, if you don't have your beginner thing figured out, like you don't really know what you want to sell, I think that Harry may not be the right fit for you. I think that if you have a couple of like good, even if you're just starting out, like you may have had one paying client, but you know that you're in this niche and you really wanna serve for people doing something kind of specific, he's gonna help you get really clear on that offer and figure out how to really like ramp it up. So I think for me, it's like the difference of if someone comes to me with just an idea for a product, maybe a bit too early, but when they're like, no, I have the beginning stages of an ugly prototype and I know kind of who I wanna serve and I know kind of what this product is gonna look like, come help. I think that's the point when people like, when they wanna add fuel to the fire and just make sure the foundation is good and can go, that would be like a really good step.

- I love it. That resonates with me too. Yeah, that makes sense. Do you feel like, is there a sort of a little bit later stage person you think that also is a good fit for me, do you think?

- Yeah. I also get a lot of people who say this, they say that they're great engineers, but they don't know how to market, they don't know how to sell. So you're someone who has a great product, of being a consultant and you get people great results, but your client base so far has only been word of mouth because you're terrified or maybe you just don't know how to go out and like do other things, Harry would be a really great fit for you to be able to step into a marketing system, that's gonna help you get out of your comfort zone and teach you how to actually sell if that's not a strong point of yours.

- Yep. Yep, that makes sense too. Yeah. Cool, I like it, I dig it. So why should someone listening take action right now?

- Because if you don't, when are you gonna do it? Like, I have a philosophy where I was terrified of doing an Ironman triathlon, where if you just Google it, your eyes will glaze over it, it's like a 17 hour triathlon that takes you over 140 miles. And I was terrified of doing it. And I knew that I had two ways to approach it, I either at the beginning of season, just start running and say, okay, I'll see how I feel after a few months and then sign up for the race or I just say, screw it, I sign up and now there's no going back. Who do you think is gonna finish that triathlon? The higher chance of success is gonna be the person who just commits and buys the ticket before training even starts, right? Because you have the accountability when he's out the door, shit got real. So for you, you need to take action because if you're serious about growing your business and you've been struggling and you aren't really, like if you don't have a system that's proven for you, you're just gonna screw around for the next two years and you're going to be back to where you are today if you don't take action and just work with someone.

- Yeah.

- That, like.

- That's so interesting. I like that a lot, it's like.

- You know.

- It's like the decision is part of the thing that actually leads to you doing the work and increase the odds.

- Yeah.

- Of it happening.

- Yeah.

- That's awesome.

- Exactly.

- That makes sense.

- Like. So that's what I need to say. If you're serious about doing this, you need help. If you've never done this before, you need help. So figure out who that person is for you and go all in, otherwise you're literally going to be in the same spot in two years. And if that's cool with you, great, don't call Harry, but if you don't like that, call Harry.

- Awesome, awesome. So.

- Yeah.

- Like Khierstyn, what's your number one piece of advice for other coaches and consultants that are listening?

- Honestly, yeah, I would say we don't put enough emphasis on understanding ourselves enough.

- Hmm.

- So what is going to hinder your success and what may even be holding you back right now may not be a lack of system or lack of coach, but it can be a lot deeper than that, it can be mindset stuff. So if you're not already doing some self discovery, I recommend to get started with a book called "The Big Leap". I don't know, have you read that Harry?

- No, I haven't.

- No. It's a book that helps you uncover what is stopping you from actually taking it to the next level.

- Awesome. That's great, that's really powerful. Yeah, I mean, underneath all this stuff, like the sales stuff is great, the marketing stuff is great, the service delivery tactics are great, all that's great but it's like, what undergirds at all is like mindset work. And for people that are maybe newer to the field like, or just business, it can sometimes sound a little woo-woo, but like.

- Seriously.

- Listen to Khierstyn, she's on to something.

- Yeah. No really, 'cause like the thing preventing you from taking action on the thing you want is yourself, because ultimately you either don't think it's possible for you, you don't think you're worth it, you don't know how, all these barriers that you.

- Beliefs.

- Put up in your life, and beliefs, exactly, that you may not even know exist and that's gonna stop you from everything you want in life. I know that sounds woo-woo, but seriously, like I am a biochemistry major, I'm not into woo, but like mindset has been one of the biggest shifts that I have in my business in the last few years.

- Amazing.

- And that's also been the number one thing that has stopped me from growing faster. So.

- Amazing, I believe it, that's awesome. Well, cool, well, Khierstyn, this has been so fantastic, really excited to see the success you've had so far. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do in the next couple of months and continue to work with you. If people wanna learn more about you and what you do, like where can they find out more about you online?

- Yeah, I guess the best place would be go to my website, which is khierstyn.com. That's right, single name brand. So it's a k-h-i-e-r-s-t-y-n.com. There you can find free resources, the Facebook group, our YouTube channel and just all the things, so.

- Amazing. That's awesome.

- Yeah.

- Well, cool, well thank you again so much, I appreciate it.

- Yeah, thanks for your time.

- All right, talk soon, bye.

- Bye.
