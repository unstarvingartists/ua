- All right, 3, 2, 1. Hey everybody, Harry Whelchel here. Today I have Filipe Goncalves and we're gonna be talking about how Filipe went from zero to 25,000 in sales in his first 70 what? 71 days working on this?

- Yeah, it was a short time. It was a, well, it was maybe 70 days, right? Maybe, yeah 65, 70, because last few days I didn't have any sales, so.

- All right, all right, cool. So before we get too further into that, why don't you Filipe introduce yourself to everybody a little bit about you and what you do.

- Right, so myself I'm all the way from Portugal and I've been online since 2015, with four years of pretty much struggle. And when I decided to become a coach, I struggled for another eight, nine months. When I say struggle, I say put in the work, the real work hours and money. And finally, a few, couple of months ago, not even three months, couple of months, when I found you is when we kind of went through different angles and I was able to figure out exactly what were the missing, the missing puzzle pieces. And today what I do online is I help business owners to increase their revenue predictably inside 90 days, through a specific concept, which is the mirroring. And I'm fascinated about that concept and I was able somehow, I don't know exactly how that happened, but I think me and you were talking about the mirroring and somehow we ended up putting that statement initially for high ticket sales reps, but then through the personal evolution of me as a coach, Harry what happened was, suddenly I'm not working just with salespeople, I'm working with coaches, I'm working with agency owners, I'm working with insurance agents and I'm working with business owners. And then I realized that for the last four, five weeks, I have this broad people that deal with high ticket sales services and they all learned the mirroring concept. And that's what I did today, most of my time.

- Awesome.

- Very short, that's it.

- That's awesome. So were you... So let's say this, so what we talked about this stuff before, maybe a month ago, you know, we talked about your first month, I think you did a little less than six grand in sales.

- Right.

- Okay. So for those who kind of wanna hear more about the early stages of that story, of your story, how you did things go back and take a look at that. And what we're gonna do today is kind of talk a little bit more about what's been going on recently since then. So let me ask you this, like, where did you get this idea of buyer mirroring is it something that you kind of pulled from different things together? Is it something that you saw in a past job, past career?

- Yeah, yeah. It's something that similar, I learned through public speaking and how to have the audience communicating and interacting with you. And one of the skills that we learned through experience and obviously through coaching is how can I have a hundred people kind of mirroring me, when we want to create certain type of reactions, a certain type of outcome out of the speech and the presentation. So then I moved that into sales, which is in a world of negotiation it's known, it's not something new, but in a broader world of sales, not many people speak about. And I think this is one of the key things that people kind of are attracted to. How does that really work, the mirroring. So, yeah.

- And so is it, is it that you as the salesperson are looking to mirror the buyer or is it that you are trying to get the buyer to mirror you? Or is it both.

- So it's less on body language and how you look and how you say things it's more on the words you use. So basically you kind of mirror the words, not really how you act physically, is more the words. And that works very well through texting, voice call or a call like this that you see the other person. And yes, you mirror the other person's words. So that allows the other person to kind of rethink what they said and go deeper and start explaining themselves. As they explain themselves, they open more of themselves and their situation. And because them being hurt in other words, we keep on mirroring, they speak more and more and they naturally release and drop their barriers. And now they somehow like you because you're listening to them and no one listen no one in today's world, you know that. So because of that and they keep on explaining any they feel the other person is listening because you just keep on mirroring back the same words. I mean, it's powerful, this has worked so well, it works. So that's what I focus on teaching my clients, how to use that skill very well, not just on a sales call, but from the entire process, from the very beginning.

- Yeah. Now that makes a ton of sense. And you're basically building a bunch of rapport you're getting them to open up and yeah. Yeah, I like it, I dig it. That's awesome. So, you know, we talked a few weeks ago kind of about your early wins and stuff. Can you just share maybe, you know, have there been any things maybe like two or three things that have been really helpful since we last spoke or things that either surprised you or just really have been impactful in the continued success you've been seeing?

- I think the main... And I felt with myself is the more you put in the work, not just random work, the work that... More you replicate the tasks that work for you and I must say those I learn with you, so more you repeat and replicate those same tasks what happens is you start having a wave of data and that data is very powerful. It's truly powerful. And this is how naturally you kind of you go read the wave in terms of how you see yourself as a coach and who exactly is the person that you are ready to help as your clients. So what happened was I was strict to one thing, and then once I finally got that big breakthrough and we spoke that first interview, I was still strict to that, but as I'm putting the hours on prospecting and listen back and listening the feedback, what happened was naturally, the most important thing is that we are not strict we have to be adaptable to what's happening because what's happening is very accurate if comes from the market. So as I'm receiving that data, Harry, what happened is I'm adapting to what I'm listening and processing. And certainly I'm shifting gradually without even noticing from salespeople to business owners. And this shifting is happening just as a consequence of the direct feedback I'm having from the market. And this is a very important skill I believe because the market will always tell you or give you the right direction. And if I'm still stuck on that, you know, what I thought was the niche, most probably that exponential growth that happened the last eight weeks roughly would not happen. So I would say that was the main thing to be aware of the data, the feedback you're getting from the market and be open to adapt to it and rearrange yourself.

- Yeah, I mean, I think the way I would say it, it's like recognize when you first set out to do something, your niche is a hypothesis right?

- Correct.

- Right, you're like a scientist, but then when you go out into the marketplace and you're talking to people, the people that resonate with you that are having the conversations that keep getting, coming back to you and like chatting with you, and you're like, why do they wanna talk to me? These are the people that are your actual niche. And, you know, normally we think about like professional traits, demographics, things like that as like the niche definition things.

- Right.

- But there might be like more things that are like personality-based, psychographic that like you're tapping into now, that is cross-cutting, you know, business owners, agency owners things like that. And you're being receptive to that, which is cool.

- A hundred percent. And that's what happened, honestly, the main difference between that our first stock and now is literally the gradual shifting of myself within the market.

- I like it, I like it. Has anything else come from that. Do you feel like it's easier to sell people have you changed your pricing? Well, as you shifted the niche.

- No, I didn't change my pricing. I didn't change my pricing. And obviously, as you work with more people you deal with different situations. Not just people you're prospecting too, but as well, your own clients, and as you work with them and you kind of what you thought would work maybe does not work that well, but this new angle works perfectly. So you're shifting yourself into that, into that direction and now one client has success. Whoops! And now the second client has success. And of course, once you feel that once what you thought was you thought you were a good coach, but now you actually know you are a good coach because the high percentage of your clients having success. So obviously you gain confidence you go again with a lot more, how do I say this? Your vibe and your it's a lot higher within the marketplace, the way you type things, how you say things, how you're on the phone on the call. So obviously that naturally grows into a higher price because you know what works now, it's proven, it's tested, your client's having success. That's why I actually changed my statement. You know I believe based on not just my knowledge, but my experience work with clients, Harry, I believe that if it's a business owner and if it's around service related and if it's around high ticket offer, I believe inside 90 days, predictably I can bring that revenue up. Not just the belief, like a satiric thing, but proven because I've other clients I've done. And just, and the thing is just getting better and better, so.

- Nice. Nice. So, yeah, like why don't we talk more about that? Like, have you had any cool client wins, any success stories that you're comfortable sharing a little bit about?

- Yeah, I had one agency owner. He works in the insurance industry and he helps insurance agencies to bring potential clients through lead generation models through Facebook funnels. And he was not able to really understand how to reach out to those insurance agents owners, and how to come across as credible with a position of authority. And he's 19 years old. So well--

- Wow.

- We did set the things the right way and he was able, within three weeks he closed his first big contract. It was like $7,500 contract for three months of service. And now he's just, he close more. So it was not just a fluke lucky, but he really knows what he's doing now. And that's a good thing Harry, because yeah, you put in a lot of work to make sure they start well, right? They set up the things well, like you did with me, but then the cool thing is like, they, once they win they kind of want to stay a little bit on themselves as well, right? They wanna test little things like they think they can add onto their own, you know, the structure and we kind of coach them now, but more like on a longer distance. Does that make sense? I'm saying that on everyday one-on-one thing. So now--

- It's less on the tactics more like strategy.

- Yes and on the mindset or on the different angles here and there, but not really on a set up the entire puzzle because that's done already. So then they can just replicate and tweak it and test it. And we keep monitoring that without really, really staying on top. And that allows you to now gain more space and time for a new client that needs to go through that first process. So it's happening with Alex, it's basically I speak with him once a week, maybe. Right, and like speaking on a call and basically it's like question here and there just tweaking here and there, new trial here and there, which is good, which now he's happy. He got the skill and he knows how to use for himself in his business, right. But now he wants to just keep on doing and now I have the time for a new client. Which is... So this is really cool. This other client I had was a coach actually that works with procrastination. Helps other people with procrastination. And this is actually very difficult because you know for someone to make a decision on the call. Right? Like you have to overcome the different objections and truly show that, you know I'm gonna help you, but on top of that he has to flick that brain in a way that you can't... Procrastination is the opposite of making decision now. Right, so and... So we have been working really hard on mirroring. So for example, with him, Rodrigo who taught me a lot longer, not really on the setup the process, but more on the mirroring in a certain level where you have to unblock the procrastination. I mean, they can see you can help, but the problem is not you anymore. The problem is actually themselves and their own procrastination kind of mindset you have to unblock that thing. So that was a good... I have another one, works in the fitness industry. So yeah, these are different stories. This one is fun. And I believe this month, November, I think, you know, two or three more, I'll put another stories.

- That's awesome. And so have you done client interviews with these folks? Any of them?

- Yeah. Yeah.

- You have done client interviews with them?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

- What was that process like?

- I think it's funny. I think in terms of marketing and marketing tool is phenomenal because people those that are out there and may be looking at you or looking at me one, they will resonate easier and two, they'll understand these interviews are very much of a coffee table type of conversation and we both are happy, right? So that energy is present in the interview. The client is happy because he acquired a client, which has never happened in his life. And the coach is happy because it was part of that process, right? So the cool thing about being a coach, Harry is that this person now, you know you shift this person's life forever.

- Permanently.

- Like forever. And this is so powerful man, this is really good. And this success stories interviews the people can see that, you know, the coach is smiling, the client is smiling. It's just a raw conversation with a couple of a set up questions and I enjoyed, they enjoyed, and the people that can be potential clients in the future, they enjoy that stuff because it's like man, look at this, it's actually, they're so happy and I'm struggling here. Though this is totally the opposite. So yeah, I like it, I really do like it.

- Do you... Have you noticed any prospects mentioning them yet on calls? Or telling you about once they watch or anything like that?

- Yeah, yeah. I'm a great student, so I follow what my coach does and says so I leverage those little angles. So now when we go into a straight session call, we prepare that so they see--

- It's just, I don't know if it surprised you, but it just surprised me still to this day that sometimes people watch like a 45 minute, hour long interview and the content is good. It's just like, yeah, it's just amazing that people, people have focus and attention for things that they think are really relevant to them and relevant to painful problems that they have. Great.

- I think just hit the right angle for the things they really give value to or importance to, they put in the time to learn.

- That's awesome. What else? Any other kind of interesting takeaways, or wins or things have been really important to your continued success?

- I will tell you this, Harry, as your client, as a coach as well, for people that maybe will listen to this interview, right? I think this is extremely important. Once someone makes a decision to hire a coach, whoever that be, is because two things happened, one, the person realized that that coach has the knowledge, the skills, the experience, the background to help, right? And two, the person resonates with that coach. So those things are in place, now the person makes decision to really follow, to really hire, you know, you, me, someone else, whatever on different niches. Once that happens, it's super important that they truly follow like there's no gray area, it's black and white. They truly follow what the coach is saying, because that thing works not just for the coach himself, but for his clients. And not just one, two, but three, four, five whatever I mean, as long as... 'Cause I mean, in your case you have many of them. So the big thing, I believe that will allow a new client to become a coach or a successful business owner in terms of revenue, it's all about revenue and then obviously help equals to revenue is to really follow what he or she has been taught. And that really adapt the formula, tweak the formula. This is so powerful. And the reason I'm saying this is because the funny thing is, we see this in different communities, right? And they come up with new things, but that thing was never within the formula. It was never present. But for some reason, they come up with this because maybe they saw the new YouTube video or some other influencer, right? And I feel it as well through my own clients. And the cool thing is like, when I see them try different things that is not in the formula, I don't say anything. 'Cause people don't learn through listening people learn through feeling. That's how people learn. So let let them try, you know, 3, 4, 5 days and the next call they're gonna call I say okay, so what was your result with that? Oh, not really, nothing happened. And they say, oh, I'm sorry Filipe you're right. Let me just keep doing what works. And it's so powerful man. I think this is a big thing. Like don't really reinvent things. If you hire a coach... Unless you're doing your own reinvent whatever you want. But if you hire a coach and you see this guy, or this girl has the knowledge and has the formula that works just replicate as close as possible to him or her and it will work for you.

- It's an interesting insight 'cause I think one thing I was really impressed with, with you when you came in is like, you know, you were doing what I was teaching and when things weren't working immediately, you know, here or there, and little things and stuff, rather than getting psyched out, losing your cool, right? And going in and like trying all these different things. You're just like, hey, I'm doing it it's not working. Like, what am I doing wrong like, you just are so cool and calm about it and it was so easy to help you and fix things and like get you the results. 'Cause you just didn't, you didn't, I don't know. It sounds so simple to do that, but I think it's rare. It's a valuable thing that you were able to do that.

- I remember how I said listen, I'm gonna follow exactly what you tell me. If you say, walk around hand standing I will be walking around hand standing. As long as I understand what's behind, but yeah and again, people really try to somehow try things on their own it's unbelievable. And I felt this--

- well, I think that.

- Once I started having more clients.

- Yeah I think my thinking is, as I've gotten further along with this is it's like, people don't understand, like there's a qualitative difference like you could both have two people doing the same thing on the service level, but with one's qualitatively doing it differently than the other.

- Yeah.

- This person can get all the results and this other person won't see any 'cause often it's binary. It's like, if you don't do it well enough, you get nothing. If you do it well enough, you get a lot. And so they think... They see other people doing the same thing they think they're doing it too and then they say, it's not working for me for some reason. And then they go and try something else. But then that other thing they're trying is like, they just made it up and turned or whatever. So it's yeah, it's a really interesting part of the human psychic.

- It is. The cool thing about, I don't think if it's cool or not, when you're a coach, you want them to succeed, right? I apologize. You want them to succeed and you almost, almost, you fall into the trap of kind of taking responsibility of the fact that your clients are having results. But then when you face your clients and let's break it down to the small things, right? The task, break down to what the puzzle is you'll notice that there's many key things missing. It's unbelievable. And that explains why you're not having the results.

- Yeah.

- And then you look at those numbers and the metrics and the little steps, you know, missing one step, one step, one step, the entire machine is broken down.

- Breaks down, yeah.

- It's so unbelievable. I was able to understand that working with people. How come someone breaks through fast and the other one two months later. It's kind of still figuring out what's the thing, right?

- It's like, whenever you're learning something new, it's like you have to put so much focus into it to learn it and you have to get all those different pieces in place so it flows through, but then once you've done it enough, it kind of becomes like unconscious mastery. And then those people are just like doing it intuitively. And so if you see someone doing it intuitively and you're like, why is it so easy for them? Why is it not working for me? It's this disconnect. But you don't realize that that person went through those couple of weeks or days or whatever time with like very conscious focus, to find the flow, to find the process so that they could do things instinctually, habitually and get the results, you know?

- A hundred percent.

- Yeah. Yeah, this is why the mindset piece of all what we do is so important. So it's like, I think we all need to strive more and more as we grow, as we build our service to not just be like, like to try to take more and more responsibility for the client even when they're having these mindset issues and provide the guardrails, the cushion, the support to help them--

- Correct.

- Prevent them from falling into that. 'Cause I find it like sometimes if somebody just falls in and they just give themselves a little bit of breathing room to tell themselves these kind of thoughts that are unhelpful, it can spiral and get worse. But the sooner you catch it, the easier it is for them to get back on the straight and narrow.

- It's true.

- Yeah.

- It's true.

- Anyway, anything else just on like the last month or so any wins or insights?

- No, I have a couple of things being cooked.

- Yeah, what's coming up.

- I said this in the last interview. No, I mean we have two more months, right? For this year, my main goal honestly, is I want to shift, I want to shift my business into some platform online and go into more like in a group version. And I'll be speaking with my coach. What's the right steps of structure, because one, the next two months, 60 days is a lot of time. I mean, it's a lot of time. You can drastically change your life in 60 days within this industry. So towards the end of the year, I really want to acquire a couple of more or less, say a couple of more of clients and truly have that proof of concept ready for more like a group version within a membership platform. Follow me? So that's why that day I asked you about, you know, the Facebook group, so I'm kind of slowly building this up, but I really need to feel that my proof of concept is at that level that I can just create a content and then manage the thing. You know, where like to a group instead of a one-on-one. So the more clients not really based in revenue needed for that step it's more people I'm dealing with to make sure my structure is perfectly done then to transport to a group.

- Yeah, the way I would say it it's like, it's about, you wanna really, really validate your service delivery.

- Yeah.

- That your formula is consistent and working. It's not about hitting a certain revenue goal before moving--

- Correct.

- To that level, yeah. I love it, man. I think that's a great goal and yeah, I'm looking forward to supporting you in that. That'll be great.

- Thank you, Harry.

- So Filipe, let me ask you this. Like, would you recommend others to work with me?

- 100%. I mean, listen, I've said this in the other interview and I've said this again. Someone that, like I said, someone that does not really know what to do, but is really serious about becoming a successful coach or a successful consultant, but doesn't know what to do. I think the way you teach right now in the market, putting all the variables in the equation to make a decision, right? I think what you do, because I'm still involved in the community I see the new people coming in I see you doing all the calls and all of that and follow up in that within the group and all of that stuff. So, and so it's almost what, or the longest maybe two months, eight, nine weeks, whatever the time is I've known you, you kept exactly the same. Do you know what I mean? Like you got more clients in because I see and you kept the exact same. And the funny thing is maybe I should not share this I saw your screenshot of your calendar the other day, right. To schedule for this call. And the cool thing I saw different names in your calendar, which I know of the set you give in there, you know, close access and support to make sure that those that maybe needed a bit more here a bit more there have what they need in order to succeed. So just confirm because that was needed for me to just confirm that yes, man. I mean, anyone that doesn't know what to do is really serious about becoming a successful coaching consultant and does not really take that much time actually a sort period of time yeah, you are the guy to speak to.

- Awesome, man. I appreciate that. It's really... Means a lot coming from you. So thank you.

- Thank you.

- I'm glad it's been helpful. So like, why should someone who's listening take action right now?

- I went from zero, not zero the pile of debt really to, from when I met you to the first day, I got 35 something hundred dollars, whatever it was the number. And then I knew at that point that my life changed forever so that you expand those days to less than 90 days. You're talking about $25,000. Now, if I thought the first month of working together, I thought my life was changed forever. Now, that is not a problem anymore. Bill's not a problem anymore. Not what I'm looking at is to expand myself. We move from a money problem, money type of thinking to a self-growth type of thinking in very short period of time. So if I delay my decision 30 days, maybe I delay breakthrough for 30 days. Do you understand this? If I delay my decision for 90 days, I'm speaking from my own case. So if I delayed my decision for 90 days, I would have to really say, let's do this let's wait for end of the year and I'll see how things go, whatever and then start fresh the new year. Imagine I could have said this to you. And in the new year, I'll be maybe with more of that than I was three months ago, right? And without even close to my perspective in terms of what I'm looking for, I'm not looking for the revenue I'm looking for the expansion as myself as a coach internationally. So in such a short period time you can literally, and it ridiculously change your life. So if, or when this person as you just said, if watching you or he's kind of thinking or kind of back there, moving yes or no if they see that you have the value, knowledge, which you do and distracting place to help them and if they are really truly committed men, there's no reason not to act. Because 60 days end of the year is 60 days, man. Well, my 60 days I break through 10 grand. And I went through 4 1/2 years of struggle and just putting money and time, you know, so.

- Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing and it's... I love it, man. It's like pre-getting this business off the ground your life is totally different post getting the business off the ground. It's like, you're more thinking, less kind of scarcity mindset, less worried about money, more about your vision, self-development, self-actualization, how much you can do and have fun.

- Correct.

- Like business, like once you hit a baseline success in business for different people, different places, it's a different number 5K a month, 10K a month. Whatever that number is after that, it kind of becomes like a game.

- Yeah, yeah, it's a game--

- And you're just playing this game and it's really fun game.

- It's a fun thing yeah, it really is. You just kind of challenge yourself now. Revenue's always as a consequence of what you do, right? But you tell yourself now, how can I now instead of, you know, how can I stay there and pay people? How can I have a hundred? How can I have a thousand? How can I go everywhere? Those type of thinking process start happening and it's cool but the key thing here is it does not take time. It does not take time and this is so powerful. So 30 days, if you delay 30 days, you're making a massive mistake. If you're serious about your business, right? If you delay 30 days or if you delay 60 days if you delay 90 days, people take 90 days as just granted 90 days what is that? Like three months is nothing, now it's a lot. Oh it's ridiculously a lot of time.

- Yeah 90 days it's like, I mean, if you had waited 90 days, who knows maybe you would have like, just been like, hey, I'm gonna put this down not even try anymore. You just never know where your mind.

- Yeah, you're right. You're right. So, like I said, there's no reason really to wait. Find a way and find a way somehow and just truly put in the work and trust things will happen because they will happen. Find a way. It was the same with me. Remember I kind of found a way I didn't have the funds. I just found a way.

- That's awesome. So Filipe, this has been so great man. I'm really enjoying chatting with you. I can't wait to see what you do in the next 60 days. It's gonna be awesome. What's your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants right now?

- So if I'm in the position of service and truly help others as my main number one goal, and if I have someone that has been there going through the process and one, and I'm hiring this person to help me take me through, now, all I have to do is believe and just focus on the now moment and the now task. And the most important thing is just honestly have fun doing it. You know? Just honestly have fun, put music on. And the end of the day, you are confident in your house or office or whatever, but most probably in the house with a nice computer and just, it's just working and it can be eight, 10 hours still it's not working hard because you're still relaxed you have to take a coffee, right? You can just have a break. You can do whatever you want. So have fun doing it, understand that, you know, that process has to happen. You have to learn the skill you have to be guided because it's how we all win in life. But end of the day, trust the process really try to help people forget about their revenue, try to help people, trust the process with your coach and have fun as the foundation and have fun.

- I love it, I love it. Yeah. It's like, if you're focusing on the right activities and then you just take that mindset of like, I'm just gonna have fun with this. You're gonna be more relaxed. You're not gonna be stressed. You're not gonna worry. It's gonna translate into you actually improving at that task and getting, but the quality of the task will go up and then it will work and then the revenue will catch up to you.

- A hundred percent.

- It will follow right behind.

- And then the cool thing is that if you actually do that, the entire industry is stressed, isn't it? Like the entire industry is stressed and they're struggling and they're like this and kind of thing. So when you are nice and relaxed and say, hey, okay, so what exactly would you need? What's going on? And you're actually honestly relaxed and having fun. The people you interact with socially online, they will notice that thing and they want that. So now naturally attracting them. So yeah, that's my main focus now in my mind and my main advice to your--

- I love it. I love it, man. That's great. Well, Filipe, thank you again so much, man. If people wanna learn more about you, where can they find out more about you online?

- My website is Goncalvesconsulting.com. That's Goncalves is my last name Goncalvesconsulting.com altogether. And that will be the easiest way or on Facebook, but yeah.

- Perfect. All right, cool. Well Filipe, thank you so much, man. It's been great chatting with you.

- Thank you very much, Harry. Pleasure, man and you keep doing that great work.

- You too.

- Bye-bye, man.

- All right, peace. Bye. All right, 3, 2, 1. Hi, everybody. Harry Whelchel here, today I have Filipe Goncalves with me. We're gonna be talking about how Filipe went from zero to $5,700 a month in sales and a little over 30 days. So Filipe, why don't you just take a moment, introduce yourself, tell everybody a little bit about yourself and what you do.

- Hey Harry. So before anything else, thank you very much for having me here. It's a pleasure. Myself, I work with high ticket sales people and I help them with their revenue and try to create a predictable way that they can increase their revenue 20% or more. And, but I did start my consulting kind of thing long time ago, 2019. So background, many years working in sales industry in the, as a health coach, right? And in the cruise ship industry. So I'll be in the cruise ship, helping these people to be healthier or moving to a healthier lifestyle. And that's how I learned sales and that's how I learned public speaking, that's how I put it all together and then I decided I wanted to do this online. I started doing online, but I wanted to do it related to business. So that's how all that ended up being today I help, you know, people that are in business or sales related and I help them increase their revenue through specific techniques.

- That's fantastic. So you have a bit of a background in sales, different roles, and I'd love to dig into that some of it in a minute, but you've only been doing this current offer though for about a month, right? It's pretty new.

- Yeah, yeah. The offer itself came as a result of working with you, you know, how could we come up with something one I can do effectively to the market needs and how we put things together in order to acquire clients, that's it.

- Nice man. So as you think about kind of what you're doing in this current offer, what do you think makes you unique?

- The buyer mirroring.

- Yeah, tell me more about that. For those who are listening I know that we've been working on this buyer mirroring thing, but I don't really know what it is. Like, tell me what is it?

- So the people are coming and asking what the hell is that? It's just like people that are into sales you know that on a subconscious mind, right? If you feel comfortable with me, you will open yourself to me easier, right? And as you open yourself too, you know, you take away that barrier and now there's closing goals of relationship. And if you have a need and to have somebody to help with that need you will be open to maybe listen and offer it for myself, right? So how do we shorten the process of, you know, you are a stranger and we... How do we make it in a very short period of time how do we turn a person from a stranger to, oh, I like this guy he sounds, you know, he seems familiar to me. That's through buyer mirroring, you know, look at the people behavior, look at the people patterns and how would they like to be interacted, how do they like to listen, how they like to be speaking to, you know what I mean? And they put that together and then once you interact with this person, leveraging those skills and those behaviors, the person will be very happy to, or without even knowing to speak with you. It's a set of skill but they never... This is important Harry, I'm sorry. I knew this skill very well because that's what we're using in public speaking that's how you have the crowd with you, right? How do you make these people listen to you? You use buyer mirroring. One of the skills. But I was not able to use that into my consulting business and this why you it's so important because this is somehow you were able to me and you, and you kind of guide me towards that direction. That's what happened.

- Yeah, so can you share a bit more about that? So how long have you been in public speaking and like what have you done in public speaking?

- So public speaking, me doing it near 10 years, right? Me teaching other people to do, I would say since 2017.

- Let's go back 10 years ago. Like, so what sort of public speaking, how did you first get into it?

- So everything started with Cruise Ship Industry, right? So I was this very young guy, 24 years old, so I wanna travel the world and make money. That was the only thing.

- Not a bad idea.

- And make money. So I said, "Well, I'm leaving here." So I signed up for this job, personal trainer. I thought I was going to be a personal trainer on board of cruise ships, right. I joined this big company. I joined a cruise ship. And then when I go there, I know I'm supposed to give these seminars, you know, for people on the cruise, this free seminar.

- You didn't know you were gonna do that that wasn't part of the job description.

- I mean, I knew that, but I thought the main thing was, you know, you do some classes, you do some personal training and that's it, but that's fine. So I don't have to do public speaking like, yeah, I have to do a seminar, right? It's a free seminar so you attract the people, you know, and they have to bring their people into a one-on-one consultation, obviously sell a package. So that's the sales funnel. Let's call it like that, right? So that's how I got introduced, but my first name was horrible, like bad, like very bad.

- What was that about?

- Honestly bad. Happen to be the laugh, to compare it you know. And I'm like, but I liked it, I liked it, I knew I could do it. So I started, you know, I decided to learn from people that do it well and acquire those skills and practice. And then over the years I became, in my perspective, I became good. I became really good, not just having these people following me in terms of what to do next, but also, you know, thinking now actions like I want to spend the money now I want to put in the time now, you know?

- So were you always like selling through these, the original public speaking or was it ever just to try to get them to like be more healthy, like sign up for a personal training, a free thing or something like that.

- Yeah, it's always great idea if you know, you need to take responsibility equals to, if you are unhealthy now it's your responsibility so it will be your responsibility to become healthy it's how we do it. You put in the time, you put in there before you put in the money, right? So that was always the mentality which... Right? So it was always towards sales, always. It was never like, hey, you guys good job, you know. It's just nothing else, it was always towards sales. And that's how it happened. So then I did this for almost nine years, most nine years.

- So you were, gotcha. So you got your start doing these personal training, public speaking seminars on cruises and then at some point you started teaching other people how to do public speaking offline?

- Yeah, so now, yeah correct. So I would... Once I became experienced, right? I would always walk with someone that has no experience like me when I first started. So what happened was I was able to find a way that worked very well for me and then I upgraded let's call it, let's say like that. And because again, I'm not an english speaker, right? So public speaking without being an english speaker if my English is not perfect you see many errors or little mistakes, but that does not mean that your message does not come across or your personnel does not coming across. I still can create that outcome I want from the crowd or from the audience. So how could I use what I've done for myself how could I do for other people, right? So that's how this new people come in this new guys and then they will be like a mess like I was in the very beginning. So I would say, listen, and come here, I would apply a couple of things that would work very well and very fast on them. So one side--

- And these were other people at the cruise company, or was this elsewhere?

- No, they'll come to work like myself. We were contractors.

- They were also on the cruise ships and you basically like informally were coaching them and helping them get better at their seminars.

- Right. And they weren't getting paid. So I decided now I wanna try this in other niches of the industries, I tried then myself I moved into the high-end luxury industry. So I left the health industry and I went to the same, in the high-end luxury talking about diamonds and time pieces.

- Got it.

- But it just changed the industry, but it uses similar concepts.

- Similar concepts. And then I feel like that brings us almost up to kind of today. So like tell me a little bit about like, before we were working together, what were you working on? What were you trying to do? What was your kind of vision at the time about your business?

- Yeah, so I thought, you know what, I'm really good at this that's what I thought and I can help people. So I'm gonna do this online. So that's why, that's what my... So in 2019, middle of the year, right I decided to learn, okay, so how could I do this online? How could I do this online? That was my question.

- Public speaking, teaching public speaking, teaching that.

- Yeah teaching public speaking and I went through research and okay, a lot of people show with the fear. Okay, so maybe I can focus on the fear of public speaking. And then I tried and obviously nothing really works, not because it's not a good niche or it's a good niche because I was not able to get the edge of how, how to go in, right? And how to have these people that have the need and listen to me and maybe I could help them. So I was maybe a year.

- Didn't you also... You wanted to like work with like, you know, upper middle executives, like senior executives. Wasn't that right?

- Right, right. So once this was already with you. Once we started, the first time I spoke with you that's where, you know, I help people with fear of public speaking.

- Okay. Cool, so that was after. So let's stay on that, yeah.

- So results were none, zero. I mean, I had a lot of hours in people speaking, but not really, not tangible results. That measurable things like--

- Were you able to get leads were you able to get clients or anything?

- I mean, you get, but not really, but they're not clients, not clients like paying clients, no. I mean, people speak with you, right on social media and have people asking questions, but not being coached by you, right?

- Right.

- That's the day I knew I could help, but I was not able to. But then you came across, right. When you came across I said, "This is what I'm looking for." Okay, but we were talking and as we started working together, then you came up with different angles. That's where everything started and the shift started there. What worked with, for example, leveraging public speaking to get promoted. That was the first draft, first formula. Okay, get promoted and that led to where to use public speaking to increase sales. Right, there was a second and all. Right and just certainly, as we are kind of testing, okay I go test, I come back, we speak again I go test, come back. Somehow we found this very unique niche that it works. It just works. It just in... And not just works because the niche has that big needs not everyone is comfortable to sell high ticket, but I know how to speak to them the people that need the service, right? And I know how to do it. So I was able... And that was like that, it just changed everything it was cool.

- I love it, man. So we're gonna dig into that in a minute. Before we do like, let's go back. So like when you were just working on helping people improve their public speaking, was that frustrating?

- Yeah, of course it was.

- Talk about that.

- Because you know, I mean, we all have been there, right? We all have been there. We know we have a skill that we can share, okay? We know this, but we don't know how to find the people that want this help with this specific skill. We don't know how to find them. They are there, you know, and they want to find you, right? They want to find you, but we don't know how to find them and say, hey, maybe I can help you. So of course, it's very frustrating when you know you have that skill to bring the hours and all of them obviously money and all the resources you have to make this something real 'cause you feel good about because you help them. But you're not having nothing back in terms of, you know, of actually helping them.

- So you always were very confident that you had value to provide and that you could get it to work. It was just like figuring out the right way to do it. You never had doubts about that.

- Right.

- That's good, that's good. So what other things had you tried before we got connected? Like what were you trying that wasn't working?

- I tried well, like different courses following that those courses, but nothing, hold on it was courses, but I mean, you could apply what you get, right? You learn, you go through the modules, you apply them and you do learn, you can learn obviously. And of course it's good to learn, but the problem is when you find the barrier and the course shows you a layout, but when you find the barrier specific to you or to your niche or to your situation, then you don't know how to fix that and it's not in those courses. Do you know what I mean? Like it's not there. So yeah, I tried different courses I tried hours and hours. Nothing really.

- Yes. Totally, totally. So where did you first hear about me?

- So, yeah. So in the process, right? What happened is when you realize that on your own you're not going nowhere or if you would go somewhere, I mean, you're still gonna waste a lot of time and energy, most probably money buying this stuff around. So I start obviously looking for it, right? I say, okay, let me see if there's someone out there that maybe can help me out, but I have to have to be very specific, right? So we spoke about this in our first meetings. Like I am very specific on who I choose. And then I found this guy and I listen and asked him what do you do, whatever. And then he told me that, listen, based on what you're looking for. 'Cause he was very good on lead gen, right? He provides lead gen it's more like, that's what I'm looking for. I need a skill, that's why I was looking for the skill of going out there, find the people that I can help, right? So, and he told me you.

- Who is this, do you remember their name or do you mind sharing it?

- Yeah, I mean, I don't remember.

- Sorry.

- I don't remember.

- Was it a client of mine or somebody else?

- Yeah?

- Was it an existing client of mine or was it just somebody else who had heard of me?

- It was another successful coach.

- Cool.

- And if I'm allowed to say his words, he said, "The next, the upcoming rising star "the rising star in organic type of a formula is Harry "so maybe you should speak with him." And that's how then I reached out to you and because we were friends already. We are friends on Facebook and I reached out to you and say hey, Harry listen, we should speak I wanna know what you do.

- So when we first connected kind of like, what peaked your interest, do you remember?

- And then yeah, so then we kind of spoke in text messages. I asked I said listen this is what I'm looking for and then, and what'd you do? And then we went on a chat, right? And on the chat, you gave me a couple of insights I said, okay, this guy knows what he's doing. I said with my thinking process. And what interested me was like one, you were listening what I was saying two, you were able to understand in the very short period of time. And that allowed me to, that was the first step to, okay let me see what maybe this is the guy that, you know, can guide me around here. The basic was your if... As you listen to me and give me some couple of feedbacks, you know, that were different angles that I was not able to see them yet, right? Opened me to, okay, let's see what we can do here or maybe let's see if this guy can really help me.

- It sounds like it was like learning a few things or getting some perspectives on what you were doing that you hadn't thought about yourself.

- Perspective yeah, perspective.

- Cool. So as you look back on the last 30 days, you know, we don't have to do like an entire play by play of every single thing that we've done together, but can you maybe speak to like two or three really big takeaways that have just been super helpful to you getting to where you're at now?

- Yeah, there's a good book I know exactly how and why I was able to make it. Number one, when we first spoke with and I use the brain, the engineer brain that I don't have, right. Remember that? The engineer brain like there's sometimes just a little thing that stops the entire machine. And when I looked at you, what was your background then I noticed that it's the engineer thing. So, okay. So he can see things, he understands that everything has to be in the right place in order for the entire machine to roll, right? So when first spoke there was the impression I had and I gave you a very powerful question that then you confirmed through your actions. So what was that question? I said, listen, Harry, okay listen, I understand access, you know, when you're doing well as a coach, the access is less and less easier to get, right? Like success of the coaches don't really cannot really give that much access because you have hundreds of people you coach, right. So how do we give that access, that direct access. So that was the first day you gave me that access in case of a need. I said, listen, all right, okay if I need that access, let's say to... Because that was the problem I had. I could not fix here or there, or figure out which direction so I didn't have the access to an expert that could help me, right? And you gave me the access in the beginning and said "Listen, it's not a problem." And then what happened was, as we go along, your program is very well, it's very clean, like a person that understands zero about coaching consulting. Zero, can go through your course and get it, okay. It's clean, it's easy to understand and not just to understand it, but easy to apply. Do you know what I mean? I understand I can apply it. I know what to do. So that's the first thing. The second thing was, as you go along with your clients, I'm talking about you Harry, as you go along with your clients, you're actually guiding them the way you teach them, you're guiding them. And if the client is going left and you think the client must go right, you will say, listen, don't go left, go right. Right and the way you work the way you do, it's easy to follow. And then the key thing was, so this was Harry the knockout was when we were three weeks in roughly, three weeks in, and me and you, I mean, we got to discussing one of the strategies, and you said, "Hey, Filipe let's go on a call "let's go like a one-on-one call." And then you came up with this said, let's go on a call I didn't ask you for that call, you come up to me. So that practice was powerful. And then that call, that call was a game changer because that call it's okay, so we'll stop blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and then somehow you gave me a couple of things saying, try this, try that. I went and then fire came up. Do you know what I mean? When that fire came up inside one week, I closed the first client and inside like 1 1/2 week I closed the second client. And then two weeks later I closed the third client. So that call was you that came up to me to say, listen, let's see where we have to fix or let's have a look at this, right?

- I love it.

- That was it.

- That's very kind, man. I love it. That's awesome. Now like, but it wasn't all rainbows and butterflies, right? Like, you know, like that call like you can talk a little bit more specifically. So like talk a little bit about how we iterated on your offer and then how we iterated on like your lead generation. Can you speak a little bit to those things?

- Yes. So my offer initially was, you know, public speaking, you know, fear all of that. So it started then we went from there to I said, okay, let's go to being promoted and use public speaking to get promoted inside your own job. Inside your own corporation then from there I went to, maybe I should have said, Harry maybe I should speak to an executive sales executive people like the high-end upper level management, let's speak to those people to improve their skills in public speaking. And then your questions were powerful. Your questions were powerful 'cause I was just coming up with options, right. But you just shooting around, you're just that's how we do things.

- That was kind of random. But then I remember you were looking at pharmaceutical sales reps for a while.

- Yes, but then I said, so let's choose one niche, right? Let's choose one niche. And then the main thing you posted was okay, I wasn't held in the health industry I speak this language so let's move and I know sales, I know--

- All this makes sense. It was very logical.

- In this path... Remember this is important, Harry like that's exactly the path that I think a successful coach must go through, which is test, no testing and oh, maybe this works and I'll tweak it. Go again, blah, blah, blah. And then you were able to do that with me and that's what made the entire difference because of my own as to, you know, figuring out how to teach people with fear of public speaking that's but then I've told you. So, and that's very important. I think that's the key of you doing so well with your clients that you can, you can listen to them and think and then somehow, you know, try here, try there. And then as you try and get that feedback and then you're able to figure out, okay, that's the venue to go the channel to go. So then we moved to the pharmaceutical and then tested out the pharmaceuticals nothing really going on and then that call came up. And this are already three weeks in, I got three weeks.

- I think you were a bit frustrated at that time. You were like, "This isn't working."

- Yeah the words... Not working with you because I could see it's not like you and I can just, you know, now we are here on a dead end place it was never like that, right? It was like, okay.

- You were doing exactly what I was telling you to do and you weren't quite breaking through yet. And you were like, "Harry, I'm doing exactly this "like, what do we need to do here?" And then we just did one more loop we did one more test and we got to get on block and working.

- Yeah and yeah, that's when that call came in. The key thing is that it's not like I was frustrated with the process of me and you together that was not, never because I could understand how you're trying to guide me in order to find that key angle, right? It was me, it was me like not being able to find it. So it was not like a process frustrated it was like myself frustrated.

- I got it.

- And frustrated, not in a negative way, but you understand.

- Totally. And so I would just say, I very appreciate the words about the course I've put a lot of work into it I'm excited about it. There's always room for improvement but I think what I would call it is like, I think where a lot of people struggle is that they just watch videos and they don't actually ask whoever their coach is or whoever they've hired they don't ask them for help on calls, they don't ask for help in their Facebook groups. And it's like, I think you've seen the value of working with somebody who's competent and having a lot of access to them to get specific help on your situation rather than just videos if that makes sense.

- Right, a hundred percent.

- Nice. So what, like what's... So you've gotten three clients, anything, any interesting, like highlights or funny anecdotes or stories with like kind of the clients you've brought on or any wins so far with them?

- No, yeah the clients are happy. I mean, again, I'm two weeks in with one I'm like 10 days with another one, like five days or something with another one.

- Is it fun?

- And you can see the smile, right? Because you feel good, not because you acquire that client for yourself equals to generate revenue for yourself, it's not that it's like, you actually, you actually change these people's life and this is pretty cool life, this is powerful, right? And, yeah there are everyday readings everyday a couple of screenshots already in terms of those little steps, those little winnings that create that momentum. But stories with them, funny stories. I mean, not really, I mean, I do have funny stories around the process of acquisition, but most the biggest thing out of all of this process, Harry, this is what I wanted to touch on is man, is the word being predictable.

- Predictable.

- Like predictable. Right now I know, like bringing another 10 or more clients in, it's just a matter of a time or my own efforts. Powerful, man.

- It's not a fluke, It's not random. It's like, you just go with the process.

- Right, a hundred percent. And once you find that angle, that's just nice, man. That's very nice. Like you know, you know, that it's in your hands. When it's in your hands, a hundred percent, that's powerful.

- So, yeah, like what... When do you think you're gonna hit 10,000 a month in sales?

- This month.

- This month. Like right now probably second right, we have a week ago. And that's the mark I wanna hit.

- That's awesome.

- And I'm cooking something so I think--

- You got some deals, you got some irons in the fire.

- Yeah. I have something going on there. So I think I will, yeah I think I will.

- Like how does it feel? Like, do you feel like it's not been that long, but do you feel like your life has changed kind of outside of business? Or do you feel like it's on opening up opportunities for you in any way?

- Yeah, I mean, of course life has changed because once you taste it right, once you taste it and then repeats it, and then you think like, so hold on, I can make something, I can make something out of this, right? So what happens is this is my own personality, my own character, I just go all in now. And literally I have, I put in all of my time, energy, focus, all and that is not even funny to doing this. So that's why in the group, I say, you know, you see me less active in the group with questions because all of that energy and time--

- You're just executing.

- Execution and that's yeah, and that's why I know that more positive things will come in. So I'm very confident now again, because once you get it, it's just work on yourself to improve inside that inside that angle, right? So, so yeah, I mean, basically I put aside my social life pretty much, and it's not even funny. And all I do is just, you know, work to build my own business, you know, to grow it now. Like, it's not like the question is, oh, how can or how the questions is like, you know, how fast can I get the second one or the third one or the fourth one and work with the clients? Like, how fast can I help them doing what I'm doing with them. Which is pretty cool as well.

- Yeah, man, like your whole, what you said earlier about like getting the clients, it's not just about revenue for you it's about changing people's lives. Like once you've got a couple of clients you're like, oh my gosh, like I have such an opportunity to have an impact to get my message across, to change the world in just a slightly small way, you know, small, honest, humble way. And that's what fires me up. And like every client you get, it's like, if you do well by them and they enjoy working with you, it's like you're building a new friend you're talking to people all the time. Like you get a ton of social activity. It's really fun.

- Yeah, it's positive, right? It's positive. And let me tell you something Harry, when we had the call, after that key call, we had the quick call because we had that call, right? And then you said, "Okay, you schedule me again." It was you, I didn't ask this you said, okay let's do this, let's schedule a call where me and you are gonna do this specific task together. Remember that? And then as I came out of that call, I said, "Man, listen, I was able to do this, this and that." So basically I was already ahead of what we're supposed to do on that call.

- Yeah.

- And as I'm sharing that with you and this time, man this is a hundred percent honest as I'm sharing this with you, I can see you happy. And then, you know what I mean? I think of that call and I say man, listen, I have to say a couple of things to you one, you know what you're doing two, you care, like you really care about, you know, your people to succeed and I could see that. Not just because you were proactive to say, hey, Filipe let's talk now. And, but it's because actually when I got those small wins you know they were not that small, they were just now growing into something big. You could see that and you were actually happy we were laughing and that was good, man. Honestly, a hundred percent those two things I think it's very important when you find someone to help to ask for help, which, okay, does this person knows what he or she is doing, right? Does he have the skill to help me and show that he care?

- Yeah.

- Those are two key things to look for a coach and then--

- And as you think about like your business, right? Like if you don't have that joy and that excitement in that, that fun you experience when your clients are succeeding, it's like, maybe that's not the right niche for you. You know, it's like that... And I think you have that, it's like that is the fuel in the tank that keeps you going, even when you have an off sales month or something's not quite working right away and yeah. Yeah, so you know, it's awesome, man. That's awesome. So going back to like the beginning of our relationship, our sales conversation, why did you decide to do business with me?

- So why did I decide to move in? When we were in the process, right to see if I would go in or not. I had two questions in my brain to make a yes decision. Right, one is, does this guy, can he really help me in the process side, like in the process angle, can he really help me with my own concern like my own problem. And the second thing was, can I have access to him if I need it? So it was the two key questions, right? Those were the two key questions. As I'm going through, you know, as we talk and I understand one, you can help me right there, the process. And two, I ask you if I could have access to you if I would need that access. That was what made me move in.

- Nice, man. That's awesome. And I know, like, I forget to think about it. Maybe you talk to an advisor or a mentor, like what kicked you over the fence, so to speak after that, that was conversations with your mentor.

- Yeah. And so he's like two times older than me, right? He's like double my age. And he's very... He knows business as well and he knows he is smart, right. So I said, okay, listen, I spoke with him I say listen, this is the situation, right? This guy can help, you know, what do you think? And he said, this was his question he said, 'Okay let me see who the guy is." And he did his own work, right. And then he came out and he saw what you do one, and he saw some interviews, success stories, and he could see as well that you know what you're doing. I mean, I was already in, but he, again, but he's he like, through mistakes you make in life, you understand sometimes you need to ask or you need to ask an opinion or a perspective to someone that maybe went through bigger things in life, so--

- Yeah, he maybe had like a bit of a nose and you wanted to see like if he thought that I checked out or if something smelled fishy.

- Yeah, yeah. He knows me very well and he knows how I think and he knows the angles that I most probably don't look at. And he always come up with some really powerful questions. So basically I said, "Hey, listen to go there and check yourself "and ask your questions yourself and find those answers." That's it.

- Nice.

- And obviously whatever the questions he had, they were all covered because then he came back to me and said "Filipe, I think this is a good guy "I think he can help you." That was it

- That's awesome.

- Nice.

- I promise, that was it.

- Simple. So would you recommend others to work with me?

- A hundred percent. 100% Harry. I mean, that's not even a question. A hundred percent.

- So what sort of people in particular, do you think I'm a good fit for?

- One, a person that has a skill or something to offer, right something to offer in terms of a service that you can help others with. So you have to have something, a skill and this person that don't know how to turn this skill into a business. I mean, it comes down to that. So I have this skill and I will be very happy to help these people and with that, they have a better life and I generate the business for myself, which I'm very happy and proud about. So how do I do, how? What step, one step, two step, three, you know that's the perfect people for you.

- I love it, man. Yeah, like I mean, you came to me and you know, somebody superficially might think that like, oh, Filipe is like starting from nothing, but really in my mind, not at all, like you have legitimate professional experience, you had valuable marketable skills. You just needed somebody to help you position it, package it, get the leads and like connect with the people. And then once you connect with them, like you knew that you could serve them and get them results and make them happy. You know what I mean?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- So that's awesome.

- Yeah, the process, okay. Okay, so how do I start? Okay, got it. What's next? Okay, got it. Okay, I've been doing it wrong adjust it there. Oh, sorry I didn't see that. You know, that ongoing process is very powerful.

- I love it. I love it, man. So why should someone listening take action right now?

- Why should someone take action right now? You're asking you me like with you?

- If someone's listening to this call and maybe they're on the fence, why should they take action right now?

- It's a very good question because one, going back to what I said earlier, the way you teach, Harry and I think, again, it comes from your, you know, engineer brain, the way you teach is so simple. Like it just goes with the entire noise in the industry, the consulting coaching industry, like the industry is noisy, right? It's noisy, everyone, right you just make it so simple that someone that has no clue what to do, just follows and has a perfect idea of what to do, right? And once... And that it's not just simple, it's very applicable. You can just apply. And as you're applying, you get the outcome now. This is very important now. You just, you can see, oh, I do this and I get that. And as you do it, as you follow the step one to the last step, which you follow, certainly boom, you close a client. So why now? Because if you do it the right way, maybe inside, you know, the first month you have already first, second client that you never had, you know, what happened with me, exactly the same. You know what I mean? So now because the earliest you go and start doing this and following it, applying it, the sooner you get your first client, like a hundred percent. That's the truth.

- Yeah, yeah that's right. And here's the thing, you already had experience in sales, right? But you still hired somebody to help you with your sales and marketing. Why is that? Have you ever thought about that?

- Yeah and because, I mean, you have experience I mean, you know everything, right?

- Exactly. That's it man, that's all I'm getting at. It's like, you never know everything it's always helpful to have somebody else's perspective on what you're doing if you really wanna get there quickly, you know?

- Correct, it's exactly that. So even when I go through your own sales training, it's powerful man, it's just powerful. And what I learn is just good. I mean, it's just good and not just good like sometimes you get that type of information you get in, you feel like you understand, but then you don't really know what to do. Do you know what I mean? But it's just clear to understand and easy to act. That's why I keep on repeating myself. It's easy to apply it now. That's very important.

- That's awesome. So Filipe, this has been fantastic, man. As we wrap this up, what is your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants?

- I mean, my number one is, I would say first thing is like, anyone who wants to get involved in the industry I think they need to really do it for the others. Like I know we all do it for business purpose and generate obviously dollars, but that has to be seen as a consequence of taking care of others in the right way. So whoever wants to join the industry, like have the skill and really want to help other people. And with that type of mentality, you know, things will happen sooner or later they'll happen, they'll happen well. So that would be the main advice. The second thing, the second thing is I would say to find someone that has the knowledge, the skills, you know, everything in place and they resonate with to mentor them to start. I will not say, I will never say to start on their own. It's just a big mistake.

- Dude, I love it. Those pieces are so good. Like the first point reminds me of, I don't know who said it, I'm sure somebody famous, but like the idea of money is the echo of value.

- Right.

- I don't know about you but in my life it's like, when I like stop worrying about like white knuckle, like being anxious about making money and I just focus on like, I'm just gonna help people and like do the best I can and help as many people as I can and work on the activities to focus on that then the money start to follow in.

- A hundred percent.

- A hundred percent, yeah. So I love that idea, I love that idea. So, cool. Well, Filipe, what is on deck for you the next few months? What do you have in store for yourself?

- So this is what I have lined up, right? We have three months to go to the end of the year.

- Okay.

- My goal is to, I want to, you know, reach that 10 client barrier. And as I reach to that 10 plan barrier, then I will have to look at moving from the one-to-one, you know, service delivery type of business model to something more like one group or, so I need to rearrange the way I will help people. So that's what I'm looking at in the beginning of '21. But I know, I know, but here's a cool thing, right? I know I will reach at least 10 more clients to the end of the year, a hundred percent. It's just powerful man.

- Easy, easy.

- I changed my hair and everything. Yes, I'm going blonde now.

- Is your hair change related to your business success?

- Yeah, yeah, yes it is. Listen man, this is the struggle this is the success, right? So from now on like two years ago, I moved from clean face to beard for a reason, you know? So now I go blonde, I just go blonde or light gray whatever. Forget black hair.

- I love it, man. All right, so if people wanna learn more about you, like where can they find out more online?

- Just look at my website, Goncalves. So G-O-N-C-A-L-V-E-S it's my last name, Goncalves. Sorry, what am I saying here? Goncalvesconsulting.com right.
