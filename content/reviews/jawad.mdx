- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here today, I have Jawad Sabra and we're gonna be talking about how he generated 12 quick chats and five strategy sessions with ideal clients in the last 30 days

- Before we working together, I had decided, okay, I want to work with international students and I want to help them. And I've already had a couple of clients but I didn't really know where things were going. I knew I needed help and I knew I needed to do something about my situation. I was looking for someone who is more successful than I have. I looked at your profile and things that you were doing, you were doing some really awesome work with other coaches and consultants and you had that way to, and it was different, it was refreshing than what was out there. And working together, I realized that we can actually focus on this specific group of students. And getting that clarity on those people has opened the door for everything else. In the window of these two weeks in terms of the stuff that we did and in terms of the niche that we decided to hone down on, maybe around 30 conversations with ICPs or ideal client personas, people who are really matching to the perfect buyer or dream buyer profile. And out of those we had about 12 quality quick chat calls. And from this about five strategy sessions. Because we did the work, I would say. We went and we did the work together and we set clear goals and we worked on them and we iterated on them. You have already closed me before we got on the conversation. And when we got on the call and you confirmed that you are the type of person I want to work with, because you weren't even trying to sell me, you just built that action plan for me that, okay, this is what we're gonna do and this is how you can do it. And these are the goals that you wanna achieve. That's the action plan, and that's how we're gonna do it. If they want to really get that clarity and that structure in the work and work with someone who's like really on point. I like the fact that you are direct and you are efficient. That's what I really like. And if someone wants that sort of work and they want to see the results and that have that motivation by working with someone. So I definitely recommend working with you.
