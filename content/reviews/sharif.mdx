- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here today I have Sharif Carter. We're gonna be talking about how Sharif went from zero to $6,500 in art sales in about 30 days.

- Long time ago Harry, back in 2010, '11, '12, I would do live art and you know, that was well received, everybody enjoyed that but I didn't really sell anything from those live events. So I was watching YouTube, I saw you YouTube ad . You caught my attention man, so yeah. The same conversations you were striking up over social media with the quick chats, I was taking that mindset and applying it in real life or to real people on the spot. The last commission I made Harry was basically following that same routine. It just blew my mind. So I watched your training and I attended some of your Q&A's and I heard some of the feedback from some of the other artists and I went like okay, screw it. I'm going out, I'ma apply everything I know right now to this event I'm going to tonight. So the two originals were a thousand a piece after the discounts. So 2000 from the originals, and then the commissions are 1500 a piece. So three commissions, 1500 4500 total.

- 6,500 total, right? So

- 6,500, yeah. Just got started and it's already paying dividends since taking this course or enrolling in this course is, I've been more consistent every day. And following a routine on learning the training, applying the exercises, taking the notes, and then going out in the real world and applying the logic in the real world. So if you're an artist who wants to make a living from your art, instead of pushing the pavement going to a day job, then this program would be a good fit for you. Because this is a real deal, you're gonna get results. And if you believe in putting in work, you're gonna get results.
