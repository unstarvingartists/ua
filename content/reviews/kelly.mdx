- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Kelly R. with me. We're gonna be talking about how Kelly went from zero to 6,200 in sales, bringing out about five clients helping musicians grow their studios.

- To be completely honest and not to knock on you, Harry, you're not a musician. And I thought there's no way he can be able to help me. He's not gonna understand at all my niche and what I'm trying to do and who I'm trying to talk to and who I'm trying to sell to. And our first conversation was like an hour, hour and a half and I let that conversation. I was like, no, he does know, and I was wrong. And I think I'd kind of pushed it off and I wasn't really taking it seriously. And when we got on another call to talk again I was a lot more confident that I was in a place where maybe I was gonna get a little bit more support and I didn't feel so lost. And that was a really big factor in me wanting to move forward. Watching some mindset training videos, reading, you even gave me affirmations. And reading through them the first time it was like, so sales and business-oriented. I felt weird, if it's like a foreign language and now it feels really natural and it feels like something I mean and I'm excited about every day. Well, yeah, I mean, now I have inbound leads which is the most wild thing in the universe but I actually have people message me cold on Facebook that I didn't add and say, I see that you help musicians build the studio, can we talk? In the last two weeks, I think I've booked four or five sales calls off of those messages. I mean, that's been a big one obviously with the influx of clients, which has been great. And I think it also makes me a little bit more willing to invest in myself and invest in all aspects of my life. Really, really, I do think in all areas of my life right now, I feel the most fulfilled and healthy and in control that I have felt in my entire adult life. And I feel like I have a clear path forward and I know what I'm doing, and I know what my goals are and I don't feel in limbo anymore. And that has come, from August or September to now, it's been a big shift and it's been a long time coming, but I'm happy right now and that's a really good feeling. So-

- Amazing.

- Would I recommend it? Absolutely. I think it's absolutely worth the time and energy and investment. Right now, if you're listening to this, I would encourage you to meet with Harry and talk to him and see what he can do to help you because the faster you can break out of that the faster and easier it is to break through those limiting beliefs and to move forward in your business and in your life and improve and not just the income, in a lot of other ways.
