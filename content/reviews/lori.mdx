- Hey, everyone, Harry here. Today I have Lori S. with me. We're gonna be talking about how Lori went from zero to about $6600 in sales in around two months.

- With your program, I didn't feel pressured. I look at the Facebook group, and you see the comments, and you are always fast to respond with answers, and information. Well, any artist that is committed to creating a business plan, if you try to take that creativity and make a business of it, you have to have direction and guidance. And so I think it's always good to start with a plan. I think it's good to have experts around you, and peers around you, that you can bounce concepts off of, you can ask questions of, so, absolutely, I think it's a great program for anyone. You have to have some intention and some focus. And then if you're open to it, and you're a sponge, you can learn so much from our conversations, from your program, from the other artists on Facebook, in the Facebook group. And, I mean, that can do nothing but good for your process. The first step to understanding and starting any process, is learning where you're going, and how you're gonna get there. So, I mean, why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you take the step to learn from people that have been there, from experts such as yourself, from other artists that are on the same journey? Why wouldn't you? If you know what to listen for, you can learn so much. So why wouldn't you train your mind to listen for what matters?
