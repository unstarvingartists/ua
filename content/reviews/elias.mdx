- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here. Today I have Elias Martinez-Bradshaw with me. We're gonna be talking about how Elias brought on his first three clients, did about 6,000 in sales helping men with their dating life.

- So I said, okay, I'm gonna do a business online and I'm gonna coach guys, okay? And when I came online not only I saw that there was crickets, the sound of crickets, because there's nothing there. You have a great idea, you have a great product, but there's nothing there. You need to start learning how to get clients. And I was stuck there for a year and a half, but it wasn't until I came across you that I literally, everything became clearer. You were hands on. Trust was there. Strategy was there, we made out a plan and then staying accountable and basically from zero to six grand it's thanks to being in your program. On my side, I admit I was very anxious to get into it and anxious because I'd been burnt with other programs. I've seen that you've given me a truckload of value but then I have to be myself and there was a call. I remember one specific call where you opened in that way to me. And you said, Elias, I am giving you the tools. So get those tools and use them your way. I'd never set up anything like this high ticket course and going through such a tough process of mindset and everything and actually seeing the first result paid full. First time, all that, you know, it was the best feeling I've ever had in my life. It boosted me, I was shouting in the house. Like I was like, yes. You know? Yes. Because, I consider that if I have three clients, it's like you have a business, it's officially, it's on. If I had to have figured it out on my own it would've taken me another two years. I wouldn't be where I'm at right now. So you had the confidence, you had the trust in your clients that they were getting the results to be able to to give me good feedback. And no one had ever done that for me, no one, no one had ever taken a call with me online without selling me. No one had wanted to put in the time and effort for me to trust them. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Harry. Whatever it is and I know you would've pushed further if I wasn't here for me to get the results. And I know that when I made the sale you were genuinely happy for me. And you take care of us, it's a great community. I'm even getting emotional. I can't believe I'm on a call with you and I've sold three clients. It's like a dream come true. And I said it to you. I said, well, you remember what I said to you, Harry, if you help me to get to where I want to go, if you really wanna be successful online, do it. There's no other reason to not do it. I don't understand that, if I want something I go and get it and I don't care. So that is, what's brought me to where I am. Why should somebody take action? Because they're gonna succeed, they're gonna succeed. Everybody is succeeding in your program.
