- All right, everyone. We've got Cherie Kloss from SnapMedTech here. We're just gonna talk a little bit about some work we've been doing for them. So, I'm gonna kick it off straight, just tell us a little bit about what SnapMedTech is.

- All right. Well, I'm CEO, as he said of a company called SnapMedTech, which has a bunch of software products for the agency business. One of them is a booking and payment platform that helps agencies find on-demand workers to fill empty shifts really easily, and also pay them at the end of their shift instantly. And it helps agencies make about 3.5% more profit margin on each booking. So, it's a valuable tool, put in agencies' hands to manage their PRN per diem staff, as well as their W2 staff as well. And we were having problems a little bit with just managing the HR force, even within our own team, as far as taking call on weekends and answering all the hundreds of calls that come in every day and through the weekend and reached out to Harry to help us manage all the leads that were coming in, because we were falling short on following through on the leads that would come in. So, contacted Harry at ConvoPanda.

- [Harry] Awesome. Yeah. So, basically there's all these nurses, these people coming into the platform to be credentialed. So we came in and we helped streamline some of that process. So what were some of the specific things that we worked on together? Do you remember any of the specific campaigns?

- Yes. Well, some of the leads that would come in, would just be when they're inquiring about our platform or how it works. And they were always the same three questions, you know. What is this? You know, how does it work? How do I get started? And, you know, it seemed kind of silly to pay someone $15-$18 to sit up there on the phone, answering the same three questions over again. And it seems like in today's day and age using text messaging or getting a quick answer via bots was the right answer to get a quick, you know, really quick answer to a really basic question. So we placed Harry, used Intercom on our website to capture all the leads and they went straight. Most of them were answered automatically by the answers that were set up, that Harry put together for us. That we helped him with the automatic answers that would shoot out, as far as like, you know, how do I get signed up? Oh, go to the website and click on blah, blah, blah. Well, that helped us decrease the number of hours that we needed for our workers to be around the clock, answering the phone 24 hours a day to really just managing the really important phone calls that came in and divert their attention to bigger things like sales and marketing. So, I think that what ConvoPanda did for us, was help us manage all the leads really, which, you know, it's a great problem to have, but even that one lead that to let slip through could've been a big one. So, now that we're capturing every single person that lands on the website, it's really helped our business grow and also helped us manage who's handling what lead and not letting anything fall through the cracks. In addition to immediately being able to answer and know who has a question and just answer it through our phone on the Intercom app. So that's been a really helpful piece of technology for us in terms of lead capture.

- That's awesome. That's awesome.

- And so again, tell me a little bit about, I know we talked, you mentioned briefly the other day about how maybe you guys were doing weekend shifts and are you guys, what happened with those?

- Yeah. We were having weekend shifts, where we were paying actually overtime, you know, as is required by law for 40 hours to our employees. Which was ending up being, you know, pretty good amount of money, $25 an hour or so, for someone to just literally be answering the same three questions on Saturday and Sunday, on the phone and in emails. And so by having the Intercom bot, only those questions that were not answered by the three, the three main questions, kind of came through to our cell phones. So we can immediately answer on our cell phone, without having someone on call 24 hours a day. So that saved us already, if you think about, well, we had them working 12 hours on Saturday and Sunday, the 24 hours of overtime every single week was saved by using the ConvoPanda system.

- [Harry] That's awesome. Well, great. Well, would you guys work with us again in the future if you could?

- No, absolutely. In fact, we're actually now beginning to implement different marketing strategies. And you know, Now that we've seen one of them work really well, we wanna keep moving forward and adding more and more pieces of Intercom to other parts of our technology. So, we're super happy with the work that ConvoPanda's done. They always tell us what they're gonna do and deliver on time. And they give us a list of what they will deliver and for a price that never alters or changes. So, we can always expect what Harry quotes you, will be the quote that ends up being the quote. And if you want extra services, he'll be very clear with how much those extra services will cost, so. We're super happy with Harry. You know, we initially had like a very short stint plan that was just 30 days, had to keep extending another 30 days and then another 30 days. So it's definitely something that will improve your profit margins significantly. Even though it's a bit of an upfront cost, that you may think you might not need, you end up saving thousands of dollars, way more in the long run. So it's definitely worth just go ahead and, eating the technology costs, because technology can replace some of those HR headaches that you might encounter in your business.

- [Harry] That's awesome. Well, thanks so much, Cherie. Anything else you wanna add?

- No, just always, you were always pleasant and very easy to work with, so we're very happy to keep engaging.

- [Harry] Great. Well, thanks so much. That's great. Appreciate it.

- [Cherie] You're welcome.
