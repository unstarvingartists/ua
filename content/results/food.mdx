- Hey everyone, Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Alexandra Saunders with me. And we're gonna be talking about how Alexandra made her first two commissions for over $1,000 in about two months of us working together.

- If I go years back, I've gone to all kinds of trainings. But honestly, it was just to sell the trainings. I never felt that they were authentic. What you've put in there is very authentic. And it's not theoretical. It's actual. What I love about working with you, Harry, is you say like if I have a question or if I have a problem, you don't just say, "Okay, you can do this." You say, "Let's get on and figure it out together," and do it right then. Right then it's done. I would recommend your program 100% absolutely. It's really fabulous. And I love the part especially that you make yourself accessible to everyone. It's not a waste of time. It's a huge, huge benefit to anyone who has these skills that you're teaching us. I don't think these comes naturally. I think these are skills that are need to be learned. And so an artist, just like I need to practice this and understand it and really internalize it so it becomes very natural. And I think every artist can benefit from that.
