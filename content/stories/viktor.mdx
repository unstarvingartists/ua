- All right, three, two, one. Hey everyone, Harry here. Today, I have Viktor Jiracek from Viktorjiracek.com. We're gonna be talking about how in about two months Viktor went from having no clients, not knowing how to do high-ticket sales, to having eight clients and making $80,000 in sales in just a little over two months, Okay? So Viktor, why don't you tell everybody a little bit about yourself and what you do for those who don't know you?

- Sure, so I help real estate beginners earn six figures, flipping houses. So essentially, what I do full time is I flip houses and I'm on track for about 20 this year. I wanna do 50 next year. So just flip houses, full time. And then what I also do is I teach people, so teach people how to flip houses. So that's pretty much it.

- Dude, awesome. And so we did an interview like this about a month ago after your first month-

- Yep.

- So can you just tell everybody a little bit about just at a high level, what were some of the wins you had in that first month. Where did you get to at the end of that?

- Oh, for sure. So the first month I got my first client and that was fantastic. That was exciting to say the least. So I got the first client, I had a good number of strategy sessions, I think, 10 or 11. I don't remember the specific number. So that was the first month. And then we did that interview and then since then have also done really well. So I got like three clients last month and then four this month. So I really liked that pace. So that's pretty much it. So it's good momentum. It's like the first one is just nice exponential growth. So that first month, like it's a lot of foundational work, fundamental stuff, and then now it's just taken off and it's off to the races. And it was almost like, I need to like slow it down. Like I don't wanna grow too fast at this point. Like I wanna make sure everything's on point. Everything's fantastic. Students are successful. So that's really, so it's a good problem to have, let's put it that way.

- Dude, I'm so happy for you. So, okay. Tell everybody, tell myself, I'm curious too. Like what are, you know, why do you think maybe you only got one client, you got 10 strategy sessions, 11 strategy sessions in month one. What do you think changed or clicked for you between month one and month two?

- I think it's just a lot of, like a lot of the fundamentals. So like from month one to month two, I got a lot more case studies and success stories. So like the first month I think I was working off of one or two and now I'm up to nine and I'm like continually getting more student success and adding that to my war chest. So I think that's a part of it. I think from the beginning-

- Can you expand on that a little bit more? Like, is it... Like how are you using those at a high level so that you know that those are making a difference in the sale?

- It's a part of the sales process. So in my sales funnel, I include that the case study. So I say, Hey, review these before we chat in any more depth basically is the rough, it's the rough for you. And it's really helpful to help them just understand like what do, who I've worked with and that sort of thing. If they don't know me too well, which they usually don't, like this is how they can better get to know me rather than me spending an hour or two with them. So that's the thing with it. I've just been looking at other real estate folks stuff and just looking at other courses and stuff in general. 'Cause I'm always curious. And a lot of people use just like screenshots and reviews and just like simple, just text review stuff. And it's not nearly as powerful. Like if you have this long form interview, which is what I do, and is what you recommend it's just so much more powerful and I've found myself over the years, just more and more skeptical, like is a screenshot real, is it faked? Is it photoshopped? Even on Fiverr today, like you can get like fake reviews and it's so easy to get. Some just so, and I think everyone's like this, everyone's just like heightened level of skepticism, heightened levels of skepticism and I'm the same. So having this good case study and just having a lot of them, like it's one thing to have one or two, which is what I had before. But once you have like a good number I'm coming up on a dozen here pretty soon. Like it's really hard to... It's really hard to like push that away. Like, oh, this guy isn't legit-

- It's really hard to maintain skepticism.

- Yeah, yeah, Well, especially for you, like to turn the turnaround here really quick, like you have a ton of case studies, you have a ton of success stories. So at a certain point it's like, Harry has 20 plus success stories. I don't know where you're at now. It's like, I think he's legit. I think he knows what he's doing.

- Either that, or he's got a bunch of like friends who have no scruples or morals.

- Yeah.

- Yeah and like, have you started to see yet, like people getting to know you maybe at the top of the funnel with those assets, or people like engaging with them on Facebook or like coming into the funnel because they saw one that peaked their interest, has that started to happen at all for you yet?

- A little bit.

- Not as much.

- Not as much now, it's more of like a bottom of the funnel asset, just like we discussed.

- Totally, and that's-

- Just like right before they're about to buy, this is what they're looking at.

- Yep. That doesn't surprise me. And it's yeah, I think that's what people don't realize is it's not... The initial value isn't a top of funnel lead generation tool over time that does definitely come into play, but it's more of a sales asset. Okay, cool. So one of the biggest things you saw a difference of was collecting more of those by the end of month two or in month two, what other kinds of things clicked or changed between month one and month two.

- So is that, and then just refining my sales skills. So that was really helpful. So we worked on that quite a bit. It's one thing-

- Did you... Go ahead.

- Yeah. This is was pretty much just refining those sales skills. So it's just like getting really good at that. Like you have a really good script, you have a really good layout flow, all that stuff. And then just as you're learning something, you're just not good at it. And you can just get better over time. So just little tweaks and there, I had a lot of like little phrases and little ticks that I'm still working on just to improve my sales skills. So I'm getting there and I'm improving, but there's that big shift and it was just incremental. Like every strategy session I did, I got maybe 1% better. It's not like from one day to the next like, oh, I'm amazing now. It's just like, oh, I made a mistake or someone else pointed out a mistake and I improved it and then I improved it and then I improved it. So that's pretty much what it was.

- Yeah, and maybe you get, instead of 1%, like 10% better, but if you get 10% better over 10 different strategy sessions, 10% then 10%, then 10% when that compounds you're like, I don't know the math, but you're like 2, 3, 5 times better at the end of that process.

- So it adds up. And then like, if you knew me from my first strategy session to my last one, like this isn't even the same person, like holy, who is this? You know, so it's totally different, which is good, which is good. So I'm getting better. And I still have ways to go, don't get me wrong. Like I'm not anywhere near perfect. But I'm on that improvement curve.

- Like reflecting back, like now where you're at, like looking back where you were. Speak to like, like, did you realize how much depth there was to having like a conversation and how much like strategy and thinking you could apply to that conversation?

- I don't know if it's a huge surprise, but it was definitely like, it was a good learning thing. Like it's not just a conversation, like there's, like there's structure to it. So I'm just trying to think of the right word. But yeah, there's definitely, I wasn't aware of that. I'll put it that way. I wasn't aware that when you're putting a conversation a certain way or asking certain questions, like you're setting them up for something or you're just trying to put them in a certain mental space.

- Yeah, maybe it's about like, yeah. How much intentionality there can be. Like everything that you do or don't do, there can be a purpose behind it to either help them learn something or help him be at ease, feel comfortable, whatever it might be in that regard.

- Yeah, and that's the one of the things I learned. Like I would sometimes miss a phrase, like you have a script and that's awesome. And I would like either miss a question or miss a phrase and it would go downhill or something wouldn't go right. And I was like, oh, what did I miss? And it turns out I missed this phrase, I missed this one thing and it messed everything up, but it was one of the things like you do first. And if you don't get that taken care of first, then everything else just doesn't flow as well. It doesn't put them through the right mental space. It's crazy, but there's a lot of like little subtle things that make a huge difference.

- How do you feel about like, do you feel that as you've gotten better and you've been practicing, like there's more and more things where you can self diagnose and you can start to hypothesize. Okay, maybe that didn't go well, because I did this because, and I'm thinking it's that, because of this principle that I know about, you know. How people buy or how they build relationships, how they build trust, do you feel like that's, you're kind of cultivating skills at all?

- Oh, for sure. Yeah, a hundred percent. And then the other thing is sometimes I say something and like immediately it's in my head like, oh, I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. So there's that. So just learning like these basic sales principles and the rest follows from that things like-

- Do you feel comfortable sharing, like any of the, like the things we've talked about, like the kind of maybe filler words or things that you used to say more?

- Yeah, no, for sure. I'm happy to share everything. Yeah, so I, a lot of, I'm still working on it in regards to like ticks. So a thing with salesmanship, it's basically, as you say, it's applied communication. And part of that is just empathizing and understanding where the person's coming from. So you wanna come at them at their level and just understand where they're coming from and understand their situation. So you can provide the solution. So you have to just work with them there. So where I had an issue with, and I'm getting better at this. It's just coming in non-empathetic or coming in robotic. So some would say the sad story, like, oh, I tried this other program, it had it didn't go well, and I'm unhappy with it, and I spent a lot of money and I feel burned and I'd say, something like, oh, that's interesting. So it's like, there was a total disconnect. So they were really high on the emotional level and something like that's interesting. Would-

- Right, they're like, pouring their heart out to you. Like, this is like, this is their life they're, you know, they're worried about. And then for you, it's kind of clinical after all, you know, that's the kind of the default. And then you're like, oh, interesting. Then you just move on. And it's just so interesting how, yeah, what we can communicate. It's not just the content, what we're saying, but also like our tone, our pacing, all that stuff. And I mean, like for those who are listening, we're gonna get into like really advanced stuff. This isn't like the only thing that sales is about. It's just some of the stuff that Viktor and I have been working on together for him, that's allowed him to level up so.

- Well, that's exactly right. Yeah, so this was a lot of little things, so stuff like that. So that's interesting where there's just a disconnect and that's not necessarily gonna kill the sale or that's not gonna turn them off fully, but it's just one of those things like, ah, I don't know. You know, it shouldn't have, it was just like a friction in the conversation. So stuff like that. Do you remember any of the other ticks? I can't think of something, I'm happy to dive deep. I just can't think of any off the top of my head.

- That was the one that came to mind for me. And I'm glad you brought it up 'cause it's yeah, you're right. It may not kill the sale or anything about like your, what we're always thinking about it's Okay. Is there anything we're saying or doing or not doing that creates an opportunity for doubt, an opportunities for breaking rapport? And when you're thinking at that level, you start like just turning over everything you're saying with a fine tooth comb, and then you start really identifying these things and it just does make a difference, it really does.

- It does. The other thing while we're on the subject of ticks. So the other thing, and I've gotten better at this as well as the sighing. Do you remember that?

- Yeah, that was the other one Yeah.

- So I would do recordings or I do practice calls with folks and they would say, oh, when you're getting the clothes and you're discussing price and all that, you do the sigh and it wasn't conscious. It was just this sigh, like exasperated, like, ah, I gotta deal with this guy and it wasn't like, I meant to do it. It was just the sigh and it would just turn people off.

- And when you did it, it didn't, you weren't actually doing it 'cause you were exasperated with them. It was probably a way for you to relieve stress, like tension, like collect your thoughts before you said what you're gonna say next. But to them it sounds like they're like, you're like frustrated with them.

- And that's pretty much it. And it was so crazy to me 'cause I was doing, like doing the close and I would just feel like they're pulling away from me during the close. Like what the hell is going on? Like, you know, everything's great up to that point. And then they're just like pulling away and they're less and less. It's hard to describe, but they're less communicative. Like they're less responsive. And I was like, what is going on? Where these people are pulling away, everything was going great. And suddenly they don't wanna like hop off the phone call as soon as they can and that's what it was. So it was those little things that really add up. But yeah, so those little ticks, so I'm getting better at those.

- That's awesome. Really cool, So what else? Any other like big, like things that just fell into place or things that clicked since we last spoke?

- I think it's those two things. So it's the case studies. It's the sales skills. I think the third thing just generally with all this stuff is there's just general momentum. I mean, we talk about the Fiverr quite a bit, so it is getting easier, which is fantastic. So it just one of those things, if you do it right, you're also just gonna start to feel this momentum. And that's a good indicator. Like if you're doing things wrong, then it's gonna be harder and harder. But if you're doing things as you should becomes easier and easier. So that's what I'm seeing, where it's just easier to get a quick chance. It's easier to get strategy sessions. It's easier to get closes and sales. There's a good community I'm building. So it's easier to get results as students. It's one thing when it's someone's siloed out and they feel like they're on their own. It's a totally different thing if they're a part of a community and they see other people seeing success and they're like, oh, sure I gotta kick it into gear.

- Can you speak to that, how are you cultivating? Or maybe you're not even doing much to do it, but like tell me a bit more about how maybe some of the wins of early clients have helped other clients take more action and see more success.

- So I'm doing a couple of things, but I do a lot of things. So the first thing I break it down as much as possible in terms of actual bowl, daily steps. And then not only do I assign the homework to the students, like I'm doing it too. So for example, like a great way to get a flip and it's basically like a numbers game, just like what you teach. So it's like, you have to make a certain number of offers and then you'll get a deal. And what I do is like, okay, just make an offer a day. That's called daily deal challenge. So just make an offer, offer a day, offer a day. And I just post my offers every day. Like, Hey, this is what happened and that sort of thing. So it helps motivate them that way. So like, oh shoot, Viktor's getting after it. Let's, you know, let's get after it too. So that's a good motivating factor.

- It becomes part of your community culture and ritual that like, this is what we do here. And then when they see other people do it, they're like, well, I've got to do it. And like, yeah, like that's social proof that we talk about on the marketing side. It's so powerful on the service delivery side too.

- Yeah.

- I hadn't really thought about that being the same underlying psychology, but now that when you said it, that kind of came to me and it really is basically that's what it is.

- I have to sell them to the course and then I have to sell them on themselves. That's pretty much it.

- Sell them on the sells, sell them on like doing the work, basically like keep going and people think, oh, if I just make the sale, great, it's done. Now I just like put them in the thing and like, you know, wipe your hands, say good luck. But it's like, no, actually you have to keep selling in the service delivery phase. Just a different type of selling.

- It's different types of selling, yeah. So there's that. So I do it like a daily post and I loop them in. I do like a weekly check-in. So every Sunday I do a post and then tag everybody in it. And then like in the comment section, the tag, I tailor it to them. I'll go, Hey, how was that one deal that we're talking about? Like, oh, Hey, how's your, how was week one? So I tag everyone in the post and my group's pretty small right now. It's like 25 students, but only it takes me something like 15 minutes, but there's like a weekly check-in. So this isn't like, oh, you bought the course good luck. This is like, I'm on your ass every week. You know, you better be making progress 'cause that's, I mean, that's what we're about over here. So that's one thing I tried out and that's working really well-

- People like that?

- People really like that, yeah. People really like that, so that's helpful. And then I do like a buddy up thing. So if two people are in a similar level of learning, I buddy them up and they can be accountability partners together. So that's working really well. Or if they're in the same city, I buddy them up and connect them and stuff like that.

- Do you post your client interviews in your group?

- I do, that's another thing as well. And when people know people, 'cause they see them, it's like, this is a small group. So they see other people and they're like, oh, this happened recently. Like one person was like, Hey, I got started the same time as this other student, I'm gonna kick it into gear. So they're like, I'm really motivated now. So stuff like that, that adds up.

- That's amazing. Yeah, so there's these very subtle, simple things that aren't that labor intensive that you can do. That then makes a difference on like, whether your clients get results or not. If your clients get results, then you get more success stories. If you have more success stories, your marketing gets easier. And it's like, yeah, that's what it is. It's like, if you can get all of these pieces interlocking in the right way.

- It's not a lot. Just like you said and touched on, it's maybe 15 minutes a day. It's nothing crazy. And yeah, I'm just trying to find more ways to like help these students. 'Cause I don't know if other folks can relate to this, but I actually want them, they spend money with me. Like I actually want them to be successful. Like this isn't just another course. This is like, you're gonna be successful type of thing.

- Yep, so what sort of results have you seen kind of working with me both? You know, tangible objective, but anything like also like personal in your life, like anything that's kind of changed in the last two months.

- So more in terms of the course results. So I've got like seven or eight folks signed up doing good there. Part of it is so that I've had good success, like so nine case studies, seven or eight sign-ups and then-

- 80,000 in sales.

- 80,000 in sales, right?

- How does that feel?

- That feels good. Yeah, that's good. I can't be mad at that, but do you wanna help these folks out. So that's part of the, that's the main driver for me. So there's that part of it. I think there's like what's happened in the past, but also take it like to future pace for the future where it's like, okay, I'm very confident. I know what to do. I know where I'm gonna be. I wanna continue on this exponential curve. So it's not just great. I had a great last month, last 30 days, like where am I gonna be in a year? And I'm very excited for that. So it's that entire piece of it in regards to this course business. It's like, everything is part of it. So there's that. The other thing-

- We haven't talked much about, like where you were, sorry to interrupt, but like where you were before in this interview, but like have you like kind of, and I think we all do this, like, have you acclimated already to like the new sales skills and the new success? Like, do you look back at all the time, like two months before and how different it was, you know, compared to now?

- It's a new baseline, yeah. The baseline shifts really quickly. And for me, it's not even, it's like a day, like from one day to the next, like, okay, this is where I'm at now. So I was used to, and I am used to like getting a sale a week is basically what I'm at. I'm happy with that for now, until I upgrade the course and can then scale it from there. So I-

- It's like, you now have that predictability, right? Like you have, you have, like, I feel like when we, before we talked together, it was like, you knew that you could do like a coaching program, but it was just a lot of trial and error, a lot of trying different things, different other opportunities programs. But now it seems like you know, like you have a path in front of you and you just have to walk it. If that makes sense.

- There's value in the clarity. And there there's a lot of clarity, yeah. But the baseline to answer your original question, it has shifted. So I got used to it pretty quick and to finish that story. So I was used to like a sale a week and I missed a week and I was like, oh shit, I was so that week. But then the next week I got two, so it worked out. But you get used to that new baseline really, really quickly, like almost too quickly. But no, it's going well. And it's, definitely hopeful for the future. Like I just wanna keep this up. I wanna be the best in the industry, best teacher when it comes to house flipping. So I'm on the path for sure. Hopefully within, possible within 12 months, I'd say.

- Nice man. Dude, I would love to see that. Like I think, I that's really, really good motivation, good drive. Like just to, if you can just be the best in your industry, but really also just every day, every month, every week, just be a better Viktor, you know, be a better offering. And if you just keep focused on like what you're doing and like making it 10% better every week, every month, you're gonna get there and you don't have to worry about like what other people are doing. You just worry about your clients and things like that. If that makes sense.

- Yeah, I've been watching a lot of like Jeff Bezos interviews recently and it'll tie back. So don't worry about that. It'll be, well, he always talks about customer obsession and I wanna do student obsession. Like if you take care of your students and they're super successful, like the rest is gonna take care of itself. And that's, I mean, that's pretty much what you teach. Like, Hey, get more clients by using your existing clients that are happy. And it's just flipping it on its head where everyone's like, oh, how do I market? How do I do this? How do I do Facebook ads? How do I sell? It's like, well, if you do this correctly, this is gonna be a ton easier.

- A hundred percent, yeah. I mean, one of my feces is like the best and only long run competitive advantage is like getting clients consistently results.

- Yeah.

- So if you do that, then a lot of other things. Yeah, like you said, get a lot easier. Just trying to think if there's something else I wanted to say there. Yeah, I think student obsession, customer obsession, that's a good idea, it's really good idea. And other folks talk about it. They talk about like, yeah, if you focus on results, then you get that positive feedback loop going and things grow. But if you just focus on marketing first and not client success, then you might have like a big bang at the beginning, if you know how to do marketing, but then eventually it'll catch up to you. It may be a few months, a few years who knows, but like the word will get out and then you'll have negative word of mouth at some point.

- And that's not good. I can't imagine fighting that loop. That would not be fun.

- No.

- So that's pretty much it. I can't, you know, I'm gonna hit 10 case studies this week. So I'm just trying to do like one a week. So I'm gonna hit 10 this week. And then hopefully I'll get to a point where it's like two a week. And if I can hit a hundred, I mean, it's gonna be fantastic. I wanna hit the thousands. That'll be a lot of, it could eventually. Yeah, man. So what do you think, like what's on deck for you? What are you gonna do in the next month or two?

- So for this month, I'm good in terms of sales. So I've got them in like the first 10 days, so I'm good. I really wanna focus on the course, like make sure it's really good. I'm really focused on that. And then I can scale it up. Like I wanna make sure it's really, really good. My students are having like a specific hangup in a certain area, so I wanna solve that problem and then really scale it from there. I mean, that's pretty much it. So just do more of what I'm doing and then help the students get better results. So that's pretty much it.

- Nice man, nice. So yeah. I think what's cool about that answer again is like, you didn't say like, oh, I've got to do this new channel. I've got to do this new tactic. Or I got to introduce a new product. It's like, you just like said, no, I'm just gonna do more of the same, but just do it better and just keep doing it, which is, t's awesome like that. I thought when I first started, I thought that like what I was teaching and I was like, oh, maybe it'll tap out at like, you know, 20,000 a month or 30,000 a month in sales. But like, I've yet to see kind of the limit to doing these foundational things that we focus on well, without having to reach for more complicated channels award, tactics, or more expensive things to do.

- Yeah, and then at that point, if I'm just doing a new channel or I'm doing something new, it just additive to what I'm doing, it's not chasing a shiny object where I spend several months on it and get nowhere. And then it's like, oh, I'm basically where I started. It's more, okay. It's just grows from there just a natural extension. Like, oh, it makes sense that you started doing that.

- Yep. So cool. So let's go back to our, when we initially got in touch, like, why did you decide to do business with me?

- I was just frustrated with the results I was getting. I was frustrated with trying to figure out everything on my own. And I was just tired of like spinning the wheels and not going anywhere. So I realized I had a good product or I had a good service. I knew I could do what I wanted to do.

- You were an expert, you'd already been flipping houses for years on your own.

- Yeah. It was like, how do I teach people to do that? So that was the thing. It was just frustration, having purchased other stuff in the past and not really seeing the results I wanted. And then so we spoke and it seemed like a fit, so move forward there. But it's just, you know, it was wasn't satisfied with how I was doing it. It didn't make sense. It didn't seem sustainable. There's a lot of things that were wrong with what I was doing previously. So then we connected and it just went from there.

- Did anything kind of kick you over the fence? Or by the time we were having our sales call, was it a pretty easy decision?

- Yeah, so it was honestly your case studies. So I saw your case studies. I watched all of them and then I was like, yeah. Okay, cool. So you didn't know that, but before we hopped on the call, I was like, yep, I'm in. Whenever, you know, he'll take me through whatever script or whatever he has to take me through. I'm just gonna say yes at the end. Pretty much. 'Cause I mean, case studies are so valuable, you know, it's just so valuable.

- Yeah, I think you didn't tell me then, but I think afterwards you mentioned, yeah, I had watched everyone and I think at the time there were a handful. I mean, it was at least five or six hours probably-

- There was quite a bit, yeah. The ones that were relevant, like the most relevant, if that makes sense.

- Okay.

- Some of them were just different, just way too different. That didn't make sense. But like some of them were really relevant to me, like course creators, course constructors stuff.

- Okay, got it. So yeah, this may be a silly question to ask, but like, would you recommend others work with me?

- Of course, yeah, definitely. Absolutely, a hundred percent. Yeah-

- What sort of people now that you're like two, two and a half months in, like, who do you think is like a really good fit for what we're doing?

- It'd someone who has something valuable to teach. So if you have something, it can be a lot of stuff. I mean like real estate, finance, accounting, I mean, it doesn't have to be wealth offer either. It can be like bodybuilding, just something valuable to teach like where you can give people a good transformation if they follow what you do. So it's that sort of thing. So if you have something valuable to teach, I'd say you're good to work with. You're fantastic to work with. So just those folks. So that mean course creator, course folks is pretty much what I'd say.

- Provided they have expertise of some sort.

- I'd say I'd give that disclaimer, yeah. 'Cause if you don't know how to teach anything, like what are you, like if you've read three articles on the topic, I mean, you're not that much of an expert, like you're an expert above your typical person, but like you should have some core knowledge, some core competency in what you wanna teach.

- Nice, that makes sense. That resonates with me. Cool, so if someone is listening to this, maybe they're on the fence. Why should they take action right now?

- It's just that exponential curve. Like you wanna get started ASAP. So if he gets started, like the best time to get started is today because of where you'll be on the exponential curve, like where you'll be in a month, where you'll be in a year. So you wanna get started ASAP. 'Cause that's just gonna compound and really grow from there. So the more you delay, the more you hurt yourself, honestly.

- Yup, yup. Yup, that makes sense. So, okay. So what would be your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants right now?

- Sign up with Harry.

- Other than sign up with me.

- Okay, gotcha. Okay, Okay. What would be your number one piece of advice? Number one piece of advice, I would-

- Focus on your customers.

- I would say, yeah, focus on your customers. Focus on your customers then find a way to share that customer result with people. It's like a two-parter. So it's one thing, like if you have a thousand people that you've helped, but nobody knows about it, then you basically have like zero people you've helped. 'Cause part of just, it's just part of marketing, like how do I share what I do articulately? So just one of those things. So it's like yeah, really focused on your customers, get them great results and then find a way to share their results with other folks who are gonna be future customers, something like that. But like-

- I dig it.

- Yeah, I would just focus on that and the rest will take care of itself.

- I dig it, I like it. Okay, cool man. So Viktor, this is great. I can't wait to do another one of these with you in a month or two and see where you're at on that exponential curve. Keep it up, man. You're doing fantastic and yeah. If anybody wants to learn more about you and what you're doing, like where can they find out more about you online?

- Just look me up online. Facebook is best. Just Viktor Jiracek. I'm sure you'll spell my name and put it on the whatever thing. So just look me up. I'm one of the only folks with this name. So find me and that's it. Reach out, I'm happy to answer questions.

- Great, Viktor. Well, thanks so much and we'll talk soon.

- Thanks.

- Bye.

- All right, three, two, one. Hey everybody, Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Viktor Jiracek, and we're gonna be talking about how Viktor had his first 11 strategy sessions and brought on his first client in about 30 days. So Viktor, before we get into all that, why don't I turn it over to you? Can you just introduce yourself a bit and share a little bit about your business?

- Absolutely, and thanks for having me as well. I do real estate flipping, I'm out of Gainesville, Florida, and I do a lot of real estate flipping and I realized the venture, like I wanna teach this stuff. I wanna teach others how to do it. It was just kind of happening naturally where people were asking questions. They wanna learn how I do it, learn what works, what doesn't work. So I just kind of started branching out from there, but that's pretty much it. I do two things. I flip houses and I teach people how to flip houses.

- Nice man. So how did you get into flipping houses originally yourself?

- So part of it is, it's a family business, so I've been doing it for awhile there. So like one of the first properties my parents were working on and like they had me work an entire weekend. Like they gave me like, Hey, remove this debris or Hey, take out these nails or Hey, do these simple tasks for us. And then I worked the entire weekend. They gave me like a $20 bill and I'd be like, oh, this is fantastic, I'm making good money.

- How old were you at the time?

- I was 14 at the time, yeah.

- Pretty good deal- So it got sort of that way, just started doing real estate. I wanted to veer away from the family business. Cause it just wasn't something I wanted to pursue or at least that's how I felt at the time. So I tried a ton of stuff. I tried like healthcare. I tried home services. I've tried wood flooring business. I tried like online businesses. So I was all over and did a ton of things. And then just slowly, eventually got back into real estate where I was working full time and then just started doing it on the side and then saw success, saw success. And I was like, oh shoot. I actually like doing this, I wanna do it. There's good money in it. And then you can build it as a lifestyle business too, which is a huge bonus. So just evolve that way and now I do it full time. So this was like a gradual slow process. I got back into to, I'm very happy with it. I don't really wanna change. I don't wanna do anything else. With my other businesses in the past, it was like, okay, as soon as I'm done with this, as soon as I hit the exit or hit the next milestone, I can do this other business, level up, do something else. But with real estate, it's just like, no, let's just do more deals, bigger deals, better deals. And it'll just, you know, keep doing this.

- That's awesome, man. So it's almost sounds like you had that early experience with your folks and then you put it down and you came back. When you came back to it, did you have to learn a lot yourself new or did you already have like a ton of it from that first round learning with your parents?

- It was pretty minimal from the first round, honestly, 'cause all this stuff I knew was just repairs base, like how to hold a hammer or how to like take out nails. So it was really very rudimentary level repair stuff. So I basically started from scratch in terms of learning. Like it was helpful to have that background, but like a lot of stuff, like how to find a deal, how to get money, how to calculate and estimate repairs. Like a lot of that stuff, I just didn't know and I had to figure out.

- Was part of the fun, like having to learn all that stuff. Or did you just try to, or was that not as fun for you? Was that a challenge?

- It was a challenge. I don't know if I'd say fun now. Now it's fun, like looking back it was like, okay, cool. But when you're in it and things are going wrong, you're like, oh no, what have I done? What am I doing? And that's just the learning process. That's the learning curve. So it's no hard feelings on my part there, a lot of trial and error, but that's why I like to do this as well. Cause I know like, I know students like, Hey, I can help you avoid a ton of trial and error 'cause I've been there. I've made every single mistake in the book twice. So that's what it was. So it was a lot of like learning from the base and a lot of trial and error. Like I had, I started to build a network of people I can call on. And then I had like family members who had success with it. So that was helpful, but it really felt like I just built it up from scratch.

- So with all that being said, like this year, how many houses or deals have you done personally so far?

- Yeah, so I think so far I'm at 12 or 13 for this year. And then the goal for the end of year is about 20. So we're on track for 20 flips this year. And the goal next year is 30 flips. So it's been a process, but I mean, I'm just really improving. It's like once it clicks then it clicks and it goes like, okay, let's repeat, rinse, repeat.

- And do you have a team or anybody that helps you or is it just you that's doing all this on your own?

- I have a team, you know, you can't, I couldn't handle it all on my own. So there was no way. So we always have a team. Like we have like contractors, I have partners. We have like a title company. We work with inspector, that sort of stuff. So it's a lot of folks that put into it-

- Make it happen.

- That make it happen, exactly.

- That's super cool. So how long have you been coaching other people?

- I started a while back in terms of coaching other people 'cause I started my initial core stuff on Udemy, but I wasn't doing real estate stuff back then. Someone told me about Udemy and I just heard about a lot of people having success.

- How long have you been coaching people in real estate?

- In real estate, Oh, okay. About a year.

- About a year?

- About a year. So it hasn't been too long, yeah.

- And what are like the types of people, like who's the ideal person? Who's the best type of person that you guys work with?

- There's a couple buckets of people. Some of the people are like, who are currently working full time. They have a W2 and they wanna eventually get into this full-time or do this on the side. So that's one bucket. Like full-time people. And there's people who currently do real estate in some way, shape or form. Maybe they're in construction. Maybe they're a contractor, maybe they're a realtor existing. Maybe they're a wholesaler. And because of that, they wanna get into it 'cause they see other people making money. So it's usually those two buckets is what I've been seeing. So it's those groups of folks who are my ideal client.

- Okay-

- Oh, and then the thing I wanna layer on top of that, I like to work with folks that are just getting started. Some of the folks I've seen who are a little more advanced, they feel like, oh, I've done this before. I don't need any help. I feel like I can still like help them out and level them up and get them there quicker and faster. There's a bit of, I think arrogance is too strong of a word, but it's a bit of like, I don't need help. I can just do it.

- Yep, I hear you. That makes sense. So like those folks who, there's that sweet spot for you right over the plate.

- There's that sweet spot, exactly.`

- That makes sense. And what do you think makes you unique or different? You know, as somebody who's mentoring and coaching other people in real estate right now?

- I think the biggest, there's two things, really. The one thing, a lot of the folks out there, they teach it, but they don't do it. So they maybe did a deal once or twice and they kind of hang there-

- And they're experts.

- Yeah, and they're an expert in there. They're on the stage and they're in a suit and they're talking about it and like, oh, I did the deal, it's awesome. Blah, blah, blah. But I'm like physically actively doing it like day-to-day. This is, it's like something I'm doing, I'm still learning and getting better. But I think the other thing is like the volume as to touch onto that one thought just like the volume, like if someone does one or two flips a year, that's a different beast than doing like 20. 'Cause like that one or two or there's that, there's that thought in the back of their head where it's like, oh, do they just get lucky on those one or two? Or do they have just a good connection or a network? Is just that volume. So at this point, I don't think it's luck for me. So that's the first part. The second part, a lot of people focus like today, the flavor of the month is wholesaling and that's the way people can get into like no money, no credit. It's super easy to get into, but everyone teaches it. Like everyone teaches it. And then I just, I like to really focus on flipping, like buy a house, fix it up, sell it. So I focus on a slightly different niche. Everyone else focus on the wholesaling niche 'cause it's just so much easier to sell a course. 'Cause so much easier to sell someone if you can convince them like, oh, you don't need money. You don't need experience. You need anything. You can make 5, 10, 20 grand checks and you hold up a check. It's like, oh, it's so easy. Let's just do this by my course. Flipping it's a little more involved, but it's better if you have money. It's not necessary. But I think those are the two things that really distinguish me. So first I actually do it. And then second I teach. I really like to focus on that flipping part.

- Awesome, man. That makes sense, that's cool. Okay, cool. So let's go back to the beginning of our relationship. Like what were you working on? What were you doing before we started working together?

- Oh, I was doing a lot of stuff. I was doing a lot of stuff in regards to coaching. I was just in the mindset like, oh, I'll just figure it out myself. And oh, I'll just try a ton of stuff and then I'll iterate from there. I'd purchased a lot of courses from a lot of other folks. So what got me started on the journey. So I mentioned Udemy. So I started doing like courses there, but it's all random courses. It wasn't real estate related. And then a year ago I signed up with another gentleman-

- Were you doing those random courses like I'm trying to like match it up with your journey in your own real estate journey. Like were you flipping at the time and just like trying to find a side business or was this before you got back into flipping yourself?

- Before I got back into flipping. So it was like five years ago.

- Got it.

- Yeah, and then I was recommended and I wanted to start teaching this stuff for the flipping. So I signed up with a guy about a year ago. Yeah, about a year ago. And he was all right. My issue was he wasn't very responsive, so he would give me homework, I do it. And then I messaged him like, okay, cool. What's the next homework? And he'd ghost me for like two weeks or four weeks. And like I paid them good money and he was just so unresponsive and yeah.

- Okay. But like, what were, let's talk about like specifically, maybe the month before we working together, like what were you doing at the time? Like maybe your pricing was really different. Your style of selling was really different. Like speak to some of that stuff.

- Yeah, so after that I did some other stuff and I was recommended and I thought it would make sense, like do a low level, a low ticket course. So I started selling it at $97. I wanted to make it super accessible. I wanted to get a lot of people in there. My line of thought was if I lower the price, more people are gonna sign up and then I can use that as a, I can just iterate and go up on price. So I did that. And the issue was like, not as few people as I thought would sign up. It's like, it didn't the not risk award, but benefit costs. Like the time I put into it just didn't make sense. So I think I sold like eight people, eight, nine people. And that's good like I benefited them. But then the other thing I found out was like, they weren't really bought in. They didn't really have skin in the game. Like they, it was so easy for them to so just buy the course, like, try it out a little bit and then just give up, but for this, and especially real estate, like it takes time to get a deal. It takes time to renovate. It takes time to sell it. So you have to be committed and persistent long-term it's not like, oh, I'll knock this out in a weekend and I'll make 30 grand. It's like, okay, you got three, four months of trial ahead of you or journey ahead of you. So that was the two things I found out. And when I was basically doing before I was in Facebook groups, so it was like a hybrid of organic where I was in these Facebook groups. And I like make a post, like connect with friends and then I'd sent this blanket posts, blanket message to them, Hey, my name is Viktor. I'm a flipper, blah, blah, blah. Join my Facebook group. And then the point was like to post content in that Facebook group. And then like, Hey, I have this course buy my course. And like, I got a lot of people that sign up for the Facebook group, but not a lot of people bought the course 'cause it was like, it was just low touch and yeah. And then-

- You were trying to do it, like, if I remember correctly, you weren't even getting on the phone with anybody. You were just like sending the payment link in messenger, right?

- That's pretty much it. So I sent up like a super simple one page sales page basically. And it was like three bullet points. I'm gonna help you how to get deals, how to get money. And that was pretty much it. And then it's like, here's the price. And it was like this super simple page. And I would just send them that link. And then I was frustrated like, oh, why aren't these people buying? Like, it's a great price, but they just weren't really sold. There was just kind of random. They were just spammy. So just didn't work.

- Yeah, so why do you think you got in your head that this was the right strategy? Like, was it coming from somebody, a coach or a mentor that you were working with or did you just think to yourself like, no, this is like, I'm gonna do it this way. This is a better way. And kind of ignore some of the advisors that were around you.

- No, so I've tried a lot of folks, I've tried three or four people before switching over to you and just sticking with you. So this was my latest person before you, like, he was making like a quarter million a year. He was doing awesome. And this was his strategy.

- Interesting.

- And like, I was like, oh God, this is fantastic. So I'll try it out. And then I tried to replicate it and didn't necessarily work. And then like he was doing some other stuff, but he didn't teach that other stuff. He was doing some, yeah. So it was just, so he was recommending it slow. He was saying like, you know, do this and you'll get this outcome. And the people in the group weren't getting that great results. Like a couple people did all right. But then it was like, oh, I made 500 bucks this month. Or I made, you know, a thousand dollars this month. But with the time and effort into it just didn't make sense. So I was recommended, I was following the advice of somebody, but it was just, I don't think it was malicious on his part. Like he didn't want me to succeed, but I think for his niche, it just didn't, it worked differently, I don't know. Maybe he was just doing some secret stuff that he didn't teach, but that's where I was at before meeting you.

- Were you frustrated at all or like, were you like, oh, this is gonna just, it's gonna, if just keep doing this another month or two it'll catch?

- I was frustrated to say the least. It was frustrating 'cause I was doing it for so long and part of it was like, oh, I wasn't making much. But the other part of it was like, I'm doing this and I know what I'm doing. Like, why can't I help people do the same thing? Like in terms of flipping-

- Like you, you're a legitimate expert. Like you have legitimate value to add. And you're like, why can't I convey this.

- Exactly. And I saw other people in real estate and they like, they don't have as much experience as I do. And they didn't like, they're selling fluff and they're selling outdated tactics and their stuff is much, much more expensive than I could ever conceive. And like, you hear these stories, like people are just getting burned by this company. It's like, they're just cycling through people, but they know how to market. So, but they're selling dreams, you know? So that was just, so I was frustrated for sure. My idea was, I come from a, like, I studied engineering in college, so it was always iterate try-

- Oh, really? A to Z, Okay. If it doesn't work, then tweak it. It's like a machine. Like if the machine input output, if you don't like the, if you don't like the output, like what change the machine. Like change the gears around and you'll change the output. So I kept on, I started iterating from the just blanket, send them a spam message. I started trying to build a relationship with them like, Hey, what are you looking to do in real estate? You know, what's holding you back all that stuff. So I'd build the relationship. And I started seeing success there. I was like, okay, cool. This is going good. But it was the same issue. Like people wouldn't buy when I send them the order page. So I was like, okay, what if I hop on a phone call with them and try to talk to them, get to know them and then sell them. So I just slowly iterated. This was over the course of weeks and months. So it was just a long going process for the entire, entire thing. So it was just like slow iteration. I had an insight like every week and I get a little bit better. It was like 5% better every week.

- Did you ever feel like in that process, you're like, you know, like this is hard, but it's not rocket science. Like I'm sure other people have done this. Like why is it taking me so much trial and error? Did you ever like think along those lines?

- Yeah, exactly my issue was 'cause I knew people who were doing it. And I was like, I know other people in real estate who are legitimate and they were doing that. Like they were doing successful huge months. And I was thinking like, okay, at this pace, I don't think I'll make this in a year. I don't think I'll make this in a decade, you know, following my own thing here. So I'm like, okay. I think the issues with me and my strategy, so I'm doing something wrong. Like if everyone else is doing good around you and you're not, it's like you and the strategy that's missing. That's the way I saw it.

- That's smart. I think it's just like a lot of times it's hard for people 'cause it's like to look inwards and look internally be like, oh, I'm doing something wrong. Like, and I think also sometimes people struggle with them. They are so determined to do it and not give up. They like, they keep doing the same thing that's not working 'cause they think that that means that they're leaning into, they're being gritty. They're doing the work and eventually it's gonna pay off. And like that, I've seen that in my own life, you know?

- Yeah, well, that was part of the thing I was thinking like, cause he was saying, oh, you put two, three months into it and then you'll start seeing results. I know that was kind of silly. And I was like, you know, with my input and output, like what if I put more time into it or get more context or add more friends, but then that wouldn't, it just didn't, it didn't scale that well, like it was like, okay, I'll get eight students in a month. You know, what, if I get 12 students in a month or, I only have so many hours in the day, like I can't like work harder at a certain level.

- Yep, so like where did you first hear about me?

- Yeah, I posted in a mutual Facebook group we have, and part of my thought process at the time I was still going through this like spam thing, spam message. And my thought was okay, well I need social proof. I need testimonials. So put up poster in this mutual Facebook group that you and I have say like, oh, what's a good software for like collecting testimonials. I didn't really understand the strategy behind it. I was like, how do I make it easy, as easy for my students to collect testimonial? They're just gonna do a selfie video. I didn't know if they had a phone, I didn't know... I knew they had a phone, excuse me. I didn't know what kind of phone they had and how to do all that stuff. I wanted to make it easy for them. So some people responded like here's a good software, here's a good software. And then someone tagged you, like, oh, you got to talk to Harry. I'm like, okay, cool. And then I messaged you and then we kind of went back and forth in Facebook messenger. But yeah, that's essentially how I managed to post in that group and someone tagged you and then it....

- Yep.

- Evolved from there.

- Cool, and so, you know, in that initial interaction there, or maybe in our first call, like and all that, like what peaked your interest?

- Well in the Facebook messenger, like you were just adding value. Like you were giving me really good pointers just right off the bat. So I was like, oh, okay, cool. I should try this and this and this. And it was like these good tweaks that I think I knew at a gut sense would make sense and work. But then I tried them out for myself and they did work. So that piqued my interest. And then like we hopped on a call that sounded good. And you just kept on giving me more things to think about like, Hey, you should do this and this and this and this. So that peaked my interest. And then, that's pretty much it. Then I saw your case study stuff like the other people who were successful in that, that got my interest as well.

- So I remember on our first call, like, I think I tried to get you on another call and it took some hand-wringing.

- Yeah. I can share that if you want. I mean, I don't know if you're comfortable...

- Yeah, I'd love to hear now that we've been working together, like, what was your experience? Like, why were you so resistant to like having a formal sales conversation with me at the time?

- So we just hopped on the phone real quick and then like the chat went well and then we wanted to go to a longer call and like, I understand how this works. Like this is my first rodeo. And like, I know what you wanna do on that first call. Like I know the end point, I know how it ends. And I was really just still frustrated with it. And I never shared this objection with you. 'Cause I knew you'd like overcome it or you have like a good point around it. So it was like, I just hired this objection 'cause I'd worked with so many people. Like I tried the Udemy thing. And I tried like another four people. I think you were the fifth in the end. But I tried so much and I tried and I spent so much money and that was the thing. I spent too much money. I was gonna list it. But I think it's too much. It's like a five figure amount. Yeah, five figure amount. And like I spent so much money. I was like, okay, well, he's gonna hop on another sales call with me. I don't wanna spend money again to solve this problem. Like if I could press a button and spend money and this problem is solved, boom, I do that. I didn't wanna go through that cycle again of excitement trying something new, Hey, this doesn't work out like advertised and then, you know, just going through that cycle again. So that was my concern. And on that call, I don't know if you've ever tried to close someone that hard, but I counted 'cause I always count 'cause I'm a salesman at heart that you can try to close me six times to get me from a quick chat to the sales call. And I'm glad you did. I'm glad it worked out. You did mention, like I asked you about it afterwards. You mentioned like, I knew what I could do for you. And I just had to make a couple tweaks. So that's why it closed me so hard, but yeah, six separate occasions. And I was like, this guy is either really knows what he's doing or he really wants the sale. And I figured even if Harry's like a 50/50 shot, I'll take the bet in terms of monetary thing. But it's worked out since then. For sure we could talk about that. But that was my experience from my end on that.

- Yeah, well, I appreciate you sharing that. It's like, it's always interesting to learn 'cause that's what I got the sense of. It's like, you've just been burned a lot. Maybe it's just, or just burned is too strong, but you had tried a lot of things and it wasn't working and you were rationally frustrated at the time, like, and hesitant to follow somebody else or like get other advice and stuff.

- Yeah, and part of it before we continue, I just wanna make a thought real quick. Part of it was like, everyone threw me in a different direction. They're like, oh, whatever you were doing before is not obviously not gonna work for you, duh. And they're like do this different thing. And I'm like, I do this different thing. And then a different coach would pop up and like, oh, that's not gonna work. You gotta do my thing, I was so tired of it. It was like 180 degrees each time, you know, hopping in different directions. I was so sick of it.

- Did you feel like as they zig-zag you around like every time, like were you... Like, okay, what this person now is saying, like makes more sense in light of the past and like it's logical and it all checks out. Or was it just like, were you not thinking at that level and you're just like, okay, well he's got some good results, like good social proof. Like I'll give it a shot and see what he has to offer.

- It was the former. Yeah, so it's like, oh, this makes sense. So this makes sense why it's not working. I'm like, oh, okay, cool. Let me try your thing. And then there thing didn't work. So how I started, I started with a guy and the first guy I worked with and he was saying like, okay, post in the Facebook groups. And like he had this whole thing lined up and it didn't work. Like for his-

- I'm happy to have you speak to that a little bit, but we don't need to get into every single.

- No, no. I'm just saying that-

- you went down.

- Okay. Fair, Okay. The point being like, they all pushed me in different directions and like, every time we switched directions, like it made sense. It made logical and emotional sense-

- At the time.

- And they had good reasoning. And then as it got into and I talked to other people, they said, you know, that won't necessarily work for you because of X, Y, Z reason. I'm like, oh, okay, cool. So I was learning as I was going and getting better, but I just wasn't getting the results I wanted.

- So what do you think, let's get into like us working together. If you think back to that last 30, 40 days, what are like, one, two, three big takeaways that you've had working together.

- Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think there's a definitive sales process that you have before I was just, I don't wanna say shooting blindly or shooting from the hip, I think is the phrase. Where it's just kind of random, I'd make it up on the fly every time. There was a little bit of structure, but not really. Like, I know the funnel, and like I know how to close a sale. Like you build rapport and then you find a need and you like build desire. And like you eventually ask for the close. So I understood sales, but I didn't have like a definitive, not even script, like a definitive guide to follow. I was doing the course before and like hop on a call with somebody. And it was a quick call and I like answered all their questions and at the end of it I'd ask like, Hey, do you wanna buy my course? And they'd say, oh, let me think about it. Let me talk to my wife. They never get back to me. So that's like one take where like a definitive sales process that works for sure. And so that was a good thing. Second thing is the power of social proof. Like those long form case study videos, that's what really warmed me up to you. Cause it's easy nowadays to like fake screenshots, like fake stats, and that's what everyone does. Like, Hey, meet this person. This is how they did everything. And they like, I just I'm skeptical about that, but it's so much harder to fake. You can even fake a selfie video, like that's like hop on Fiverr and pay somebody for that. So I'm even skeptical about that. But this long form interview where they're getting into detail and talking about their story and like you looked them up and they're real people. So that what really convinced me. So that was like takeaway number two. Like these long form, 20 minutes, 60 minute interviews, just how convincing it was and how people can relate to that. So that was the second thing. I think the third thing is probably like the power of a tweak, T-W-E-A-K, like if you're doing 90% of the things right. And we've talked about this in depth where it's sometimes binary, so you're doing 90% of the things right but you forget one or two things or even three things. And it just, nothing happens.

- You get 0% results.

- You get 0% results. But then you make those couple tweaks and you're off like a rocket, I think it was those three lessons. So the power of the case study, like a good a sales process I can stick to. The other thing with a sales process, like a couple of my other folks, they had like sales scripts and sales processes, but it felt like kinda, not scammy, but not truthful in what they were saying. Like they would kind of make something up and just use that. It's hard to explain, but-

- Like, it was like a theoretical script that they made, but they weren't actually personally using it every day or something like that.

- That was part of it, yeah. So just felt like you would use it and like the reaction isn't what you would want, you know? So like kinda break rapport. They kinda distance themselves from you, at least in terms of a conversation. I just didn't like the scammy. I like, like real sales, human sales, talking to people like, Hey, can I actually help you? Okay, if I can help you, then let's let's move forward. I didn't like the like sales hacks, like the tricks and all that stuff. Like say this phrase and they'll buy from you. I didn't like that sort of stuff.

- Yep, yep. What about pricing? Anything on pricing?

- Oh, right. Yes, that's the other thing. So before I was selling the $97 courses, I wasn't getting the same buy-in and now of course we can talk about if sign up that one student and I'm getting like much more buy in. They're much more committed. They're working harder and that's helpful from my perspective. I don't wanna just sell something to somebody and they never do anything with it. Or they learn one or two things. Like I want them to actually get their first deal, actually want them to hit those six figures in terms of flipping. Like I wanna transform their life as much as possible. So that was pretty much it. So one of the first things we talked about was like raising pricing. I kind of fought you at first, but then I eventually came on board and like, yeah. So in terms of pricing, I can have to sell 10 times as many people, 10 times, plus as people to make it, and then that quality of student wasn't there before.

- Isn't it funny like when you change it, like it feels like a big psychological difference, but then when you just start saying it, you're like, oh, like this sale at 10 times the price or 100 times the price, it's not necessarily that 100 times harder, you know, or 10 times harder.

- No, it's not, it's not 100 times harder, 10 times harder. And that's the good thing, you know, that's definitely in my benefit.

- Nice man. So speak to some of the results, like you also, so you got 11 strategy sessions in the first month. How was that process like? Have you really had that level of predictability in that process before?

- Not really, no. So with you, I went from zero to one, essentially. So it went from never having done a strategy session to doing a strategy session. And so that was a big leap in and of itself. And then after getting that one, it was like, okay, how do I get it consistently? So right now my goal is like five strategy sessions a week. And I'm hitting that consistently and predictably. So that makes it a ton better. And then it just becomes a numbers game, like, okay. I close a certain percentage of these strategy sessions. Oh, I didn't get one this week. Okay, next week I'll get something or whatever this month. But it becomes a numbers game and then it was predictable for sure. So that made it better. So yeah, I did 11 in the first 30 days of working with you. So that was pretty good. I got three, like three soft yeses. So what happened, like they, I like, Hey, this is the price let's get started. Like, okay, cool. I'm in, I'm like, awesome. And then somehow from there to collecting payment, I'd fumble it. Like, I didn't say something right. Or I miss something and they're like, oh, let me actually think about it. And like one guy, one guy was good. Like he was like, okay, I can't do it right now. I gotta like, let me hop off the call and take care of payment and they'll hop back on. And then he hopped back on. He was like, oh my fiance got into a car accident. And I was like, oh, I can't do this right now. So something went wrong-

- They like sent you a photo. I don't know if that was really the case, but-

- They sent you a photo of the car, right?

- Sent me a photo of the car, yeah. So I don't know if they have that on file or if that really happened. And then he said, Hey, follow up with me in like two weeks. And I followed up with him and nothing happened. So like a lot again, bringing it back to those little tweaks, like little things that I said or didn't say that mess it up. So I got three soft yeses from those 11 and I didn't get one yes. So that was good.

- Yeah. So it's almost like, like once your sales skills get even better, right? Like you might have, yeah. You might've closed four out of 11, which is like almost a, it's like a mid thirties percent close rate, which is a pretty good close rate, you know, once you get up to speed fully up to speed, you know?

- So I'm excited about that. And then I feel bad for the people, like, 'cause I wanna really hone in those sales skills and just focus on what you're doing, which is what works and part of what I'm learning, it's not necessarily like learning sales. It's like learning, like learning your script, like learning what works for this niche. 'Cause my real estate sales and negotiations are a little bit different. It's like learning the phrases, learning the scripts, learning the tweaks, like how you set it up. And then yeah, I just legitimately feel bad for these people. Like they had a bad sales call with me and now I can't help them. Or they feel like it didn't go well-

- I'm it wasn't bad. I'm just, you know, don't beat yourself up. It's just like, maybe you didn't quite get them over the line or convey enough value to get them to pull trigger.

- Yeah, so that's the tricky part, but it's, you know, you have to learn, you have to learn somehow. So that's part of it too.

- How did it feel on a positive, how did it feel to get that sale?

- Felt good. No, it felt awesome. It felt really good. Yeah, that was just, it just worked, you know, went and it clicked and, and then the student's doing really well and you know, after the races and getting deals and all that good stuff, but it was good confirmation. Like for me it was like, okay, I've gotten from A to Z, I've done it once. Okay, let's just do it again. Let's just repeat what I did and let's just continue, continue at it.

- Exactly, it's like once you do it with a lot of that stuff in business, it's like once you do it the first time, you're like, whoa, okay. If I can do it once, I know I can do it again. You like, you feel like internally, what were the things that had to happen to get to that outcome. And then you just do more of that.

- Exactly, yeah. So that's good. That's good confirmation. And then now it's more, not scalable is the right word. It's more not repeatable, like with the price and like, it's more, I can actually do it. Like before, when I got a sales $97, it was like, okay, cool. I have to do this. I don't know 20 more times for it to be worth my time. And now it's like, okay, sustainable, that's the word.

- Sustainable.

- Now it's more sustainable. Like I can actually, you know, I can actually focus on it and it's not like for me, it's less like I don't need the money necessarily. It's more like I can pay all my expenses. Like this is worth my time. I'm not at minimum wage before is what it was, what the breakdown was. So it's sustainable is my point.

- I like it, yeah. And like another way to think about it. Like you and economics are much healthier, right? Every deal you're profitable on. So going back to like our sales conversation, why did you decide to do business with me?

- So post quick chat, when we spoke the first time and then pre strategy session, our quick chat was on Wednesday and then purposefully, I set it for Monday for us to do strategy session. I watched all your case study videos, all of them. The ones that were relevant.

- All of them?

- Like you had some software ones, like specifically software. And I was like, yeah, I don't know if that's me like SAS company, all that stuff. It's like, yeah, that doesn't relate. So that's what sold me. That's what put me over the fence. So before we even hopped on a strategy session, I was like, yeah, okay. I'm gonna sign up. Like, I'm sold, I'm in, Harry's gonna take me through his process and it's gonna be helpful. I'll learn some more, but I just gotta do this. 'Cause the other folks are... And I just related to some of the folks, 'cause sometimes with these courses and such people and course instructors give like the best examples, like the best case studies. And they're just unattainable. It's like how Erin made a million dollars in the first month. And like you break down their story and it's like, oh, they had this advantage, this advantage, this advantage. And they already started and you break it down-

- They had made 950,000 the month before.

- Exactly, that's part of it too. And like, you hit that 30 day mark and you're like, oh, I didn't make a million dollars, what am I doing wrong? And so it just detracts from your own experience. So like some of your case studies, cause it was just like I think that zero to one. And I was thinking like, if I can just get to that zero to one in X timeframe, cool. And then after that one to three or whatever, if I just hit that first milestone in X amount of time, then it's worth it. So I really related to that. Cause he had students at different levels.

- Nice man. Nice, so like, was there anything in particular like that kicked you over the fence on the call or is it like you were just totally kind of bought in and as long as like, I didn't come off like a crazy person on the call, like.

- No, I think it was pretty much it, I mean I was in, I was in for the most part. I was, yeah, I was 99% in, I just-

- Looking for confirmation.

- Looking for confirmation, making sure we're on the right page. Yeah, so I was pretty much in, I was pretty much in-

- Cool.

- At that point.

- So would you recommend others to work with me?

- Oh yeah, of course, of course. Like I wanna, in doing this, like I wanna save others that trial and error and that headache of trying to do other stuff and not being successful with it. And like spending like money, time, energy, all that stuff, trying to do other stuff that it works, but it doesn't work as well or it's not sustainable or it's not like those other things that we've mentioned and talked about. Like for me, like I've had really good results. I'm looking to continue it definitely. So I'd highly recommend others work with you for sure.

- Yeah, that's great. And it's like hearing your story makes me think it's like, it's not just about saving money, it's not even just about saving time. It's like, there's a bit of a morale element to it. Like if you keep doing it on your own and you're just like doing things that are not working, like you could get to a point where you like give up or go do something else. And that's like, that's just really sad every time that happens, you know?

- Yeah, well that was me like a year ago. So I started, I was hustling for about three, four months at the course stuff and then not getting results. So I don't know if I gave up, but I was like, okay, I'll just put this on the back burner. Like I'm doing this flips, I'm doing great. Okay, let's just focus on that. So I did, so I put on the back burner just kept on putting it off. I'll get it to a next month, next month and then eventually picked it up again. So I might not have picked it up again, which would have been terrible. That would have been not good at all.

- Yep.

- So there is that morale part of it too, where like if something doesn't work or at the very least, if you're not making progress, like, oh, I hit milestone one and milestone to get a sale is number three. So if you're not making that good progress, then you can eventually give up. And that's probably the worst thing.

- Yeah. So who do you think were especially a good fit for?

- I think you're a good fit for, so people like me and so people who have something to teach, like something valuable to teach or who can teach something, like they can learn something and teach it. So it's that sort of thing. I think it's people who are established.

- You already had experience like you're a professional and you had expertise to offer, basically.

- Just basically how to market and sell it, was what I was looking for. But for other people, I'd recommend like people who are getting started or people who are already established and wanna take it to the next level. And then people who are like me where they're starting at zero, they have something to teach, but they wanna take it to from zero to one. So that's who I'd highly recommend work with you. And even I'd throw in there like people who maybe they have worked with someone in the past and didn't go so well in terms of like a coach for coaches, if you wanna call it that. And then at the same time, like people who've never had a coach as well. So I'd recommend both sides of spectrum. There's a lot of value in what you teach above and beyond, you know, just one other teach as well.

- I appreciate that, thank you. Cool, so why should someone listening take action right now?

- So it's a good question. It's highly recommended to take action just because like where you are now, if you start and where you will be 30 days, if you start implementing now is gonna be a world of difference. And for me it's paid off for sure. So that's the same mindset. Like get started now and in 30 days you'll be surprised where you're at. And I was surprised, honestly, I was like, I'll get a couple of strategy sessions. You'll knock it out if I get a sale, cool. But then I did better than expected. So that was good. So that's the why you should take action now. I mean, if you don't take action, now, the troubling part of it is you're just gonna have that morale downgrade, like time wears down on you. Like every week, every month, every year it just wears you down. And eventually you'll just not do anything, which is the worst. Like I always tell my students, like there's three options in terms of not moving forward. Like there's do nothing, and that's the worst 'cause there's a reason like you're thinking about this, there's a reason you wanna do this. And like, if you do nothing, that reason persists. So you just kind of continue in your unhappy state, which isn't great. Second option is you do it on your own or try to do it on your own. There's a lot of trial and error. Again, you spend a lot of time, you can spend money too. Like you can just throw money at things that don't work. And the third option in this case, and this scenario is like work with Harry and like save yourself that time, save yourself energy, save yourself morale, money, all that stuff. And actually get results, you know, get results.

- And not even, it's like not just save morale. It's like, once you start seeing results, it's like a battery that starts charging and you get more confident and more fired up and then it gets easier and easier. And then once you get your clients results, getting the next client is easier. And so you get this like positive feedback loop going.

- Yeah, it's that positive.... And then each one becomes easier. And then for me, like, what's cool is in terms of student success. So as soon as one person's is being successful, like, oh, this person did X in Y timeframe. Like it motivates all the other students. So I really like that too. So there's that aspect of it. But I like that positive feedback loop. So it feeds up on itself. So in terms of that and like exponential functions, like you wanna start as soon as possible. Like you wanna start yesterday in terms of taking action 'cause it it's gonna grow exponentially. And that's how I see my growth going. It's like start now, start ASAP. 'Cause it's just gonna grow faster than you think. And I'm surprised where I'm at three days out, which is where we're at. And then hopefully, you know, fingers crossed it's gonna to be even more surprised one year out. And I'll be like, whoa, I was selling a course for $97. It's now, you know, it's 97 million now or whatever.

- I can't wait to see where you're at in 90 days.

- Yeah.

- You know, even that, like, I think you'll be surprised. I like it, man. So what is your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants?

- Number one piece of advice. Oh, that's a good question. Number one piece of advice. I think if I could talk to myself in the past, even like a year ago, I would say like, Hey, don't be stubborn. Like learn from someone who's doing it. Like don't be stubborn. Just like learn from someone who has a good track record and they can prove that it works. And then they have good logic, good cause effect relationships for why it works. So that's my number one piece of advice. Like get rid of your ego for a second, do what works and stick with what works. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Once you get to a certain level, once you surpass Harry in terms like sales and all that stuff like that. Okay, then you can start to tweak and talk about like, Hey, maybe we can improve this and this that's when it makes sense. But yeah, just get out of your and take action now. And then, no that's pretty much it. Yeah, just learn from people who are higher up than you and where you wanna be.

- I like it, that's good advice. That's really good advice. So Viktor, this has been fantastic, man. Loved hearing your story again, can't wait to see what you do in the next month and the following month. If people want to learn more about you and what you're doing, where can they find out more online?

- Just look me up. If you look up my name, Viktor Jiracek, then I'm like the only person with that name. So just find me. I mean I'm happy to help. Yeah, just let me know how I can help, but that's the best way to find me.

- Great, alright man. Well, thanks so much. I'll talk to you soon.

- Appreciate it. Thanks Harry.

- Bye.
