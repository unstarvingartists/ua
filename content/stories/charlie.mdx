- All right, three, two, one... Hey, everybody, Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Charlie Price back and we're just doing a quick update. So yeah, Charlie, let me turn it over to you. Like, what are we celebrating? What sort of updates do you have today?

- Yeah, yeah, Harry, I got good news for ya. So last month, we actually hit 33K, which was fantastic, that's a record for us in revenue. And then for this month, for the month of September, we're on pace for 45K.

- Dude, it's so exciting, man.

- So I'm really excited.

- I'm so happy to hear that, that's awesome. So why don't we like do this, like for those who haven't caught your first interview, can you just tell everybody a little bit about yourself and your background?

- Yeah, absolutely. So, hey guys, I'm Charlie Price, I'm a CPA. What I do is I work with accountants to help them improve, help them grow their business with high profit offers and attraction-based marketing. I have helped about a hundred accountants in this space at this point, and excited to help many more down the road here.

- Awesome, man, that's awesome. So last time we caught up, we were talking about how you went from, you're doing about 6K a month and went to 12K I think in the first month of us working together, it's been a couple of months now, like probably three or four months. So if anyone's interested in that and like what we did early on, go back and take a listen to that interview, but like, Charlie, why don't you just share a little bit, like, what are some like two or three things that we've worked on together more recently that's really impacted things and helped you reach these new revenue goals?

- Yep, sure. So I think the number one thing that really stands out to me, we implemented some pre-sales assets in the form of social proof and client interviews that have really, really helped us move the needle in close rate and conversions. And it allowed us to bring on more clients, help serve more clients. And I think with the help of Harry with that, that's been a huge game changer for us, for sure.

- That's awesome, man. Yeah, and I think you were telling me about how you hired a sales rep, right? You have a sales rep doing your calls?

- Yeah, we brought on a sales rep just about a month ago now, yep.

- Okay, and I wonder if like, with those assets, like, you're the founder of the company, if you're doing the sales, like, you know everything, like your close rate is probably gonna be higher than anybody you hire. So do you feel like having those assets like allows your sales rep to close more easily, close at a higher rate, even though they're not the founder or the face of the company like you?

- Hmm, yeah, 100%. And even when I get feedback from that sales rep, he's like, "Man, that deal closed so easy!" 'Cause you know, I asked him about the case studies and they've clearly helped us for sure. So, thank you so much Harry for that.

- That's awesome, man, that's awesome. Well, I mean, and I would say again like, and you would agree with this, it's about getting a good win for your client and documenting it. So ultimately the seed of it is the fact that you are doing well by your clients and they're getting results working with you, right?

- Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah! The client success has been great. They love the support that they're getting and we're definitely getting some big wins. I mean, we just recently took an accountant from 1500 a month and now she's doing over 20K a month. So we've been able to use that as definitely an asset to leverage. So, I'm just so excited with the people I get to work with.

- That's awesome, man. Yeah, so on the service delivery side, have you made any improvements or changes there recently?

- Yeah, we're right now, we're actually systemizing out our cadence on how we check in with our clients, and we moved from one coaching call a week to two coaching calls a week. So we're actually increasing support, and we plan to continue to do that as we kind of kind of grow our resources and as we continue to grow. So I'm really excited about that.

- That's awesome. So, okay, more support for the clients. And have you seen, as you've lifted that support, do you feel like the results are getting more consistent? Or faster or anything like that?

- Yeah, yeah, And then actually that brings up another point, Harry, 'cause like I think something that you really help on is simplification and just keeping things kind of as simple as possible, and having the most streamlined process possible and just taking off the fluff, and that's something that I've taken from working together with you and I've implemented that. And that's something that we're working with on now. You know, I've kind of revised the course, the client path, I guess, is what you wanna call it, to really shorten that and to get them to that promise as quick as possible. And that's actually, that's helped for sure.

- That's awesome, man, awesome! So streamlining kind of the path, the plan of what they have to do. What else, what other wins or insights, or things that have been useful in the last few months?

- Yeah. Another big one Harry was must working through, you know, I went through your mindset modules and just having conversations with you on mindset, I think honestly it's was really big on building my kind of CEO brand, and like kind of how to think like a business owner and how to, yeah. I mean, just how to deal with adversity in life and business, I think is a good way to put it, you know, so that was really helpful.

- That's awesome, man, I'm glad to hear that. Do you feel like were there like net new things that you were learning or was it just more having me be able to kind of help give you my opinion about your specific situation and kind of give you tailored advice? Or what do you think was so helpful about it?

- I think it's a combination of two things, which is what you just said, which was honestly, just some really good genuine advice on things. And then another piece was, I think, implementing daily habits, you know, morning mindset routines and daily habits. And I definitely have taken that and borrowed that and harped on that in my program as well, it's so so so important. And being able to implement some of that stuff has just been a game changer.

- I love it, man, yeah, like I wish I had started the mindset practice years ago in my own life. Like if someone's listening, and they don't know what we're talking about, that's totally fine, but it's like, yeah, like the old Harry back in the day, like I would've just thought it was kind of like woo woo and hippy dippy, and like now I'm just like so sold on the idea of doing affirmations and just working on that stuff. And it's just amazing how much better it makes your day to day, and you do see more results operationally in the business as well, if that makes sense.

- Yeah, and I'm the exact same way Harry. Like I was definitely like what's this . You know, like when I first got into business and like still sometimes I kind of have that feeling every now and then with certain things, but it's my beliefs have definitely shifted just from, I don't know, the environment I hang out with and just the results that I've seen by practicing it and trying it out. So, if you guys haven't done any mindset work, I definitely recommend it.

- That's awesome, man. Yeah, like what else, what else, anything else?

- The one other thing that comes to mind is, Harry and I know you think very like systematically and logically, and there's a way that, when working with Harry, that he kind of takes, he's very good at like kind of, I don't know how to say this, but like take the emotion out of things and like just look at things from a logical picture and a rational picture. And I think I've really taken, I've really tried to take that mindset and use it at times when I can to systematize or to solve problems in my own business for sure.

- Yeah, man, do you have any examples of that?

- I'm kind of blanking right now, but it's been multiple, multiple things.

- What about offer structure?

- Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think like... Well, yeah, I mean, I think it was like, we would test out certain offer structures or things like that, and it's like, "All right, well, let's test this, "let's test that and see which one will work better."

- What about like handling conversations with clients and like diagnosing their issues and things like that? You feel like it shows up there at all?

- Yeah, I mean, I think something that comes to mind is, I've had anxiety in the past for maybe like clients, or maybe I've had anxiety about clients complaining or clients worried about their results or something like that. And I think from your view, you look at it rationally. Well, how many people have complained in the past? Like what leads you to think that? And thinking like that is really helpful. 'Cause I'm thinking from a place of emotion there, and Harry is thinking of a place from logic and rationality. So I think that's a good example that I can think of where that's come up.

- I'll remember that.

- It took me a second to think there, to jog my memory, but it's been multiple conversations we've had, and just...

- I think that's come up multiple times with us, like two, three times that nervousness over the months. And then, so do you feel like that's lessened and kind of dampened down as you've gone along? You've been working on your mindset and reminding yourself.

- Yeah. It definitely hasn't gone away 100% but it's improving. And...

- Can you share about that time when you like reached out to those clients that you were nervous to reach out to, and then they were really happy, can you kind of give, do you know the story I'm talking about?

- Yeah, yeah. I think I had a couple of clients that kind of weren't showing up or weren't doing what they were-

- Weren't as active.

- Weren't as active basically, yeah. And you know, I was definitely under an assumption of like, well, if they're not responsive, if they're not showing up, then they're upset or they're not happy. But I ended up reaching out to them and they were just fine. So they were excited, we jumped back on the call, and we got them back on track 'cause everything was fine there.

- Yeah!

- That was a good example.

- It's like it's hard, I think most people, myself included, like don't have that attitude by default, but it makes life richer and more fun and more enjoyable if you have that like more glass half full, like assume the best mentality. And then when you assume the best, it's not true, then fix things, you know?

- Mm-hmm, yeah!

- And I've seen that in my own life. Every once in a while I have those same issues, but I think it's, yeah, you have to actively remind yourself of it. It's not like the default.

- Yeah, yeah, that's 100%. And I just enjoy like I know every time I feel like if I'm on a coaching call with you and you're answering other people's questions, I just enjoy how you dissect and answer people's questions because you almost always come at it from a systems rational way to solve a problem. So, if that makes sense?

- Well it's like, if you really want to solve the problem and move forward, it's the only tools you have. If you wanna like have somebody pat you on the back and like emphasize that there's other tools you have in the toolbox to do that, but it's not necessarily going to solve the problem per se. So...

- Yeah.

- Yeah, well, that's cool, man. Well, anything else, any other interesting takeaways or updates since we last connected?

- I think that's the other big thing, is I'm working on systematizing the business, coming up with processes, systems, we're not quite there yet, like it's not the priority for you guys that are maybe just kind of starting out like a priority, so get strategy sessions, do strategy sessions, serve your clients.

- That is one thing I've drilled into your brain. Yes, exactly.

- Yeah!

- Wow, that's great to hear!

- Yeah, yeah! So that's still the priority, but yeah, I'm making time for starting to think about how we can optimize processes with these systems, so.

- Yeah, with that like systemizing, do you feel like you have fewer moving parts in the business? Do you feel like it's easier to run the business? Do you feel that you're making more money? Like, do you feel like that's accurate?

- Yeah, I think before I had the sales rep in the door, I was juggling a lot, and that's just how it is when you're first starting, right? You know, you're generating your own strategy sessions, you're doing your sales, you're doing your own delivery, I mean, it's a lot. But it's a phase of the business. And Harry I know you know about that. But fortunately with the sales rep, he's come on, he's actually in the accounting space too, so he's not only doing the sales, like helping out on the sales end, but he's actually helping out on some of the accountability.

- Oh, just a little bit?

- Yeah. Which has been fantastic. And that allows me, I know that I'm neither a genius or one of the things that I'm really really good at is generating the strategy sessions. So I'm generating them up like being able to just focus on that and the content has been really helpful for the business, yeah.

- So I know that you do a lot of like posting and stuff like that, you have an existing audience who generate leads? Can you speak to it a little bit? Are you still doing some of the stuff that we've learned about or we worked on together on kind of once you've originated a lead, advancing them, warming up, like turning them into a better lead, is that stuff that you're still leveraging?

- Yeah, yup, 100%. Like, I jump into conversations with people and I treat them like humans and emphasize with them, and don't just go right into like sales mode with them. So yeah.

- Have you've seen that pay dividends later in the sales process? Like it it's definitely worth that effort, right?

- Right, yeah, yup. Yeah definitely!

- Nice, man. Well, cool! Like, would you recommend that others work with me still?

- Oh, 100%, yeah! I think Harry it's been amazing working together with you, anybody that's looking to grow their business, maybe they feel like they've plateaued, maybe they feel like they're stuck, they're looking on getting their processes ramped up. They wanna know how to generate more strategy sessions, do more strategy sessions properly. We didn't even talk about your sales process, man! I love your sales process and-

- Are you still using it?

- Honestly, I kind of let the sales rep do his own thing that worked best for him, so we've kind of shifted from it a little bit, but that's not to say that I don't like it. I think it's a great process.

- Hey, man, no worries at all. And I'm sure there's parts of what I've taught you that are still influencing what you're doing sales process-wise.

- Ah-ha, yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah! 'Cause we definitely are talking more about the process of what we do, like the logical.

- Getting them to buy into not just price, but also like what you're gonna do? Yeah, yeah, I got you!

- All right, yeah, yup!

- And I think that's big. But yeah, 100% guys, if you're looking to optimize your offers or your services, get that marketing down and generate more strategy sessions or how to properly do strategy sessions, then 100% Harry is the person to talk to.

- Who do you think in particular I'm a good fit for? Just kind of knowing what you know now, like four months in, whatever it is, into our relationship.

- It's a good question. I think, I think anybody that's probably, maybe they've plateaued or even if you're, I would say anybody that's like just kind of plateaued or maybe you're just getting started and just don't really have clarity or a sense of direction, I think that Harry would be ideal for you.

- Yeah. Yeah, sorry to cut you off, anything else there?

- No, you're good, yeah.

- No, I think that's fair, I think I'm seeing again and again, that the folks who are making anywhere from 2000 a month to 10,000 a month, and often they've just kind of like white knuckled it and brute forced their way to that point.

- I wasn't gonna give a revenue number, but that was exactly what I was thinking of. Like zero to 10, or two to, you know, maybe like they a couple sales to 10K. Yeah, I think that would-

- But they really looking to like figure out like how can I make this into like something that is just sustainable, and simple, and easier to run and stuff like that.

- Right, right. If you feel like you're repeatedly like banging your head against the wall and maybe you're feeling some burnout too, you know, Harry is really good at simplifying things and finding ways to like make things easier. So I think that that could be a game changer for you.

- That's awesome, man, I appreciate that. So why should someone listening take action right now?

- Well, if you wanna grow your business, if you wanna serve more people, create more impact, and ultimately grow in scale, then that's why I would take action on it. Sure.

- That's awesome, man. That makes sense. And if you had to give some advice, like what's your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants right now?

- Good question. I think, number one piece of advice is I would say, look at what you're doing on a daily basis, and look at your daily habits and routines and make sure they're aligned with who do you need to be to get to where you wanna go. So, do your daily habits align with the future that you wanna be? And I think that's really important. I know that's not like the most techie nuts and bolts advice, but I think honestly, that's the really, really important.

- It's really good advice. And do you feel like, I mean, it's scary to admit that, and then to actually work on changing yourself, like, did it take some courage for you to like recognize that and take action on that?

- Yeah, yeah, I'm still working on it, man. I'm still working on it, I think everybody kind of is to an extent.

- Everybody is.

- Yeah. But yeah, it does, it does. It's scary, it's scary.

- It's really deep work. It's fundamental work. That's good, man. So thank you so much Charlie for catching up with me here, I am so excited, 33K on track for 45 this month. Can't wait to check in with you in a few months to see where you're at then, I'm just really excited for you, man, this is great.

- I appreciate that, man, I appreciate it. I'm excited for both of us.

- Yeah, man, yeah, you're doing well. So if people wanna learn more about you, find more about you, where can they do that online?

- Yeah, so you guys can just check me out on my Facebook profile, it's Charlie Price, or I have a Facebook group, Marketing Success for Accountants and Bookkeepers. We have about 2100 members in there now, so jump on in, come say hi.

- Cool, all right, man. Well, thanks so much, we'll talk soon.

- All right, see you Harry!

- Peace.

- Bye!

- Bye!

- Three, two, one... Hey, everyone, Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Charlie Price from Cardinal Thrive, and we're gonna be talking about how Charlie added 12,000 in revenue through organic methods in about 30 days with Vouch. All right? Now, before we get into that, I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. Charlie, why don't I turn it over to you? Can you just share a little bit about yourself, your business and what you do?

- Thanks Harry, I appreciate it. So, yeah, basically I work with accountants basically as a business consultant/coach, some would say, but I help accountants go from generally five figures to six figures. Although I've worked with some six-figure and seven-figure accounting businesses as well, but we've really help them with creating high impact, high profitable offers. We help them with implementing marketing processes, and we help them out with implementing a sales process. And we've talked to about 70 accountants at this point.

- Amazing man, that's awesome! So how long have you been doing this?

- Just about a year and a half. I was in accounting in my past life for about 15 years before I got into consulting. But yeah, about 18 months I started the business.

- Okay, cool! And tell me more about that, so like why? You had this accounting career, what was the thought process to like make that transition?

- I knew that... You know, I know a couple of things. And I realized that accountants needed a lot of help with aspects like marketing and sales, and I knew that was becoming more of a passion of mine. And I was losing some of my passion also in terms of hanging out in Excel spreadsheets all the time, and it wasn't what I felt like I was called to do anymore, so I decided to take the leap and really made the jump and started the business.

- Very cool, very cool! So you've been doing this about a year and a half, 70 accountants you've helped so far?

- Yeah, approximately 70 at this point. Yeah, yup.

- Very cool. And so what do you think makes you guys unique? What's different about the way you help your clients?

- Well, something that we implemented recently in terms of, and I know we're gonna talk, we'll touch on this I'm sure, but focusing on the high profit offers and that is I think a game changer and something that a lot of other consultants aren't talking about. Other than that, I work closely in a tight knit with the people that I work with and I freaking care, so...

- That's awesome, okay, very cool, man! So let's go back to the beginning, like before, how did we initially get connected, do you remember?

- I reached out to you, Harry. I came across you on Facebook, and I saw, oh, this guy helps out with referrals and sales process stuff, and I was pretty intrigued by your Facebook profile basically, so I reached out to you and started a conversation.

- Okay, cool! And like, what were you doing at the time that you think, why do you think it piqued your interest?

- Good question. So, I knew the bottleneck in my business was in sales, and was on the sales process side of things, so I was just looking for additional resources in that realm of how can I improve revenue, close rate, all those sales process metrics? And that's including referrals and that kind of thing. So I figured it made sense to reach out to you.

- Yep, and so at that time, when you're trying to increase closed rate revenue, things like that, what were you doing? What were you trying to do to fix this things? Were you frustrated by anything you were currently doing in your business and not seeing results?

- I didn't feel like I was running sales calls as well as I could have been. I felt like in discovery, I was just in the weeds way too much, I wasn't like seeing, I think I just wasn't being consistent with the framework that I was running through my sales calls, so I thought that was a big issue. I was pricing lower, probably it was underpricing services for the value that I was delivering, 'cause we've been consistently delivering great results. So that's what comes to mind?

- Totally. No, that makes sense. Why do you think you were doing those things? Was it just like inertia? Like what do you think kept you kind of in those groups?

- The group of what? Underpricing or which group?

- Mm-hmm, mm-hm!

- Yeah. I think maybe the inability, I think there was some things where we weren't properly conveying the impact on the sales call, so we weren't properly conveying the value, so it was more difficult to ask higher prices, if that makes sense.

- Yeah, I think I remember like, not only that, it was like you didn't keep the value in like the true transformation potential fixed in your head as you thought about what you were doing for your clients, does that makes sense?

- Yeah, for sure, there was definitely some mindset issues as well. Although we were getting results for clients, I think I was always like, "Well, could I get results for this client on sales calls?" And like, I was still having some doubts on that end.

- Do you feel like the virus that's going on right now, the coronavirus, did that have any impact on like your close rate or like how things were going before we started working together?

- I think in an indirect way, not from like a capacity for prospects to pay or anything like that, and maybe they had a little bit more fear, but more so in terms of that COVID had kind of interrupted my daily routines, my daily habits, and that had caused some effect on my mindset and where I was in my head when I was getting on these sales calls. So I think that was an issue.

- Cool, cool! So we got connected, we had a couple of conversations, in those initial conversations, the sales conversations, like what peaked your interest? What made you decide, okay, this is somebody I wanna work with?

- We went really in depth about what specifically we could do in my business to really move the needle and to actually make progress in this stuff. So I know that when we were talking about our action plan, we talked about getting case studies compiled, and we talked about optimizing the sales process and social proof. And that just really appealed to me that in that initial conversation, even before we even started working together, I felt like we had a clear path to success. And I just saw like, "Okay, Harry has got this path laid out exactly." And I was completely aligned with it, so.

- Cool, so yeah. It sounds like you got some clarity in that process and perhaps it wasn't novel things, but it was just like putting things in the right priority.

- I think 100%, yeah. Because I think when you're the CEO of your business and you're growing, you're really wearing all the hats. And I think sometimes I was trying to fix marketing or fix other areas of the business and I wasn't necessarily focusing on what mattered. And we got a lot of clarity on that call of exactly what I should be focusing on to move the business forward and to grow the business.

- Yeah, I mean, one thing I kind of felt, and correct me if I'm wrong, but like, you're spread a bit thin, right? And we're still working on that, but you have a number of different irons in the fire, as they say, you know?

- Yeah, iron is in the fire in terms of, what do you mean?

- Well, you have a couple of different offers you sell, right?

- Ah-ha, yeah!

- And you have the different Facebook groups. Yeah, do you see what I'm getting at?

- Yup, yup! I have a couple of different offers out there, and I'm running an 1800-person Facebook group and just making sure to stay on top of that. And I'm also doing the proper marketing to generate appointments, and you're right, I felt like I was spread thin.

- But just what I'm getting at is it's easy to see how you could, it's hard to get clear on like what path is the path forward if you've got more stuff that you're juggling at once. So yeah.

- 100%

- Charlie, so tell me a little bit about, so what did we do next? Like what have you done to get to that 12,000 a month in the last 30 days?

- Yeah, without a doubt, the biggest needle mover that we did, Harry, was redefining our offer and getting crystal clear on our core offer. And we were able to double the investment cost of the price of that offer, because we were able to be really clear about what the promises that we're delivering for our prospective clients, and we just really be clear about what we're offering in that service, and that was a game changer. And now I know when I'm on these sales calls and I convey that properly, I can see their eyes light up and I can see that they're really interested and intrigued by the offer. So I know that we're doing good things on that standpoint, that's been a game changer.

- Dude, that's so cool, I haven't heard that yet from you. So that's awesome. So you can emotionally feel that they're more fired up about what you're presenting to them?

- Yeah, 100%. I feel like it's been a lot of interest for sure, we've garnered more interest.

- Cool. So, okay, we did that, and then what did we do next?

- Yeah, and simultaneously while we were reconstructing or optimizing that offer, we were also working on the pre-sales and social proof side of the business. So I compiled case studies with successful clients that we already had success stories, we just needed to do some client interviews, get in there, and we were able to knock those out. And I posted those on Facebook, Harry, and like, man, I've had more inbound leads in the past month and people reaching out to me than I've ever had. And I attribute that to those interviews being posted on Facebook. Yup, yeah, 100%.

- Really?

- Yup.

- Okay, cool. Is it just ballpark, like how many have come in?

- Between five and 10 I would say, so I want that number, I'm really happy like that's more than it has been and I think that's gonna continue to increase, but I've been happy with that.

- That's really cool! Okay, so what was the process like collecting the interviews, were there any surprises?

- Not really. I mean, I know Harry we did a practice call on how to actually conduct a case study interview, which was something I would have never thought about, like actually how important it is to structure the case study conversation properly. So that was really helpful, because I've done a couple of those kinds of things and I just wasn't doing those interviews properly. So doing that was super powerful.

- What were some things that you learned that are really important with structuring the content.

- Get into the weeds a little bit, like talking about the details of what did we do in the process and then what do we do in the process. And then like paint that picture for the potential client. So that really helped on that end. And I think that led to some of the people that have been reaching out, so...

- Nice man, nice! Okay, cool! So we did that, and then what happened next?

- Yeah, people started reaching out, I mean, that was great. I started posting those case study interviews on Facebook.

- Where else did you use them? Did you use them anywhere else?

- We set up some email sequences so that when people were booking calls, I was sending out... We set up an email sequence so that we made sure that those case studies got in front of people before the strategy sessions. So that has been powerful. Making sure that those people are watching those videos prior to the call, and that they show up even warmer than they were before.

- Got it, got it. And do you think, I mean, you tell me, I don't know, do you think that those assets have helped people be okay with your higher pricing?

- Yeah, 100%. I've had people say, "Oh, I've really related to Maria." And it's somebody that's enrolled, so for sure that's been impactful.

- That's really cool! That's really cool.

- Yeah, yeah!

- And I'm excited to keep building up those assets. I know that that's gonna compound as I keep building those out.

- Yeah, so tell people a little bit more, what sort of results have you seen so far in terms of just like objectively tangible financial results?

- Ah-ha! I mean, I can tell you guys, just last month alone we brought in 12,000 in revenue and-

- How was that the month before or recent months?

- You know, it's kind of varied, but I would say generally we were doing about five to 6K, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, but I feel like the path to getting there or two, I mean, that's a huge percentage in itself, but also when you double an offer, you know, double the investment price of an offer, there's a lot fewer yeses, a lot fewer calls, so I'm really excited about that. Like I'm excited, 'cause I know that 12K is just the start of where we're going.

- Yep, so we doubled the revenue with fewer clients being brought on board, and there's a ton of headroom to expand and like use the existing strategies you've been doing to generate leads to keep growing the business just with organic right now.

- Yeah, yeah! And to be clear guys, I mean, I have two deals pending right now, right at the finish line for 6K each. so that 12K could be, could be 24K here pretty quick.

- That's awesome, man. So yeah, like looking ahead next 30 days, like what is on deck for you, what are you focusing on?

- Right now and looking over the next 30 days, I want to continue to refine the sales process, the sales conversation, just make sure that I'm reflecting on each and every sales call that I do, which is something that Harry's encouraged and has been really helpful with. So that's the main thing, it's just continued to optimize sales, 'cause I know that's still the number one bottleneck and the number one place for improvement, which says a lot about how much potential we have in the business. So I'm so excited going forward, man.

- It's funny to me. I just feel like I talk to a lot of people and it's just so easy to get spread too thin and thinking like it's all these other issues in their business, but really, it just comes down to like sales and focus. Like, does that resonate with you? Have you been like, "Oh my gosh, there's just so much more depth "to just continue to refine the sales conversation, "to refine the different pieces." And like just sit with that one piece of your business and get it better, than try and like do all these other things. Like any thoughts on that?

- Yeah, yeah, I mean, I completely agree with that. If you could stay really focused in that number one bottleneck, that's what's gonna really blow up the business and really help you grow. You don't wanna be moving an inch in every direction. Because you're not really gonna see that progress versus focusing on that one thing and really getting that fixed. So you helped me a lot with that.

- And like before we were working on that, did you realize there were those gaps in your sales call or did it take like having somebody really work with you and show you those gaps? You're like, "Wow, there's so much more I could be doing!"

- I knew I was underperforming on sales, but I think you opened my eyes to seeing like a lot more potential. And on top of that, Harry, I wanna throw in like something else that we talked about, was I was making one offer and I was making one offer on the sales calls guys, and I would say that the investment is this or this many payments of this, right? And we worked together, Harry, to really not... What am I trying to say here? To have multiple offers, to have the ability to negotiate potentially, or make sure that we have the right offer for them.

- Right, I mean, and just simply, you were kind of negotiating against yourself, so you would say, "Here's an attractive offer that is the best offer for me, "but also good for you, but if you don't like this offer, "here's this offer that's much more attractive to you, "but it's not gonna get me cash in the door as quickly." Or whatever it might be. And you were saying those in the same breadth and found that, surprise, surprise, most prospects were taking the better deal.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah! So with you saying that, yeah, that's the other thing, coming cash flow has been helped a lot with what was talked about through the sales process as well.

- Dude, that's awesome! So going back, why did you decide to do business with me?

- I really liked how consultative your sales process was and the sales conversations were, and I just, when you laid out the action plan, I was 100% on board with it. And I knew during our conversation, that's what would move the needle the most for the business right now, so that's what it was for me.

- And was there anything in particular that like kicked you over the fence like at the last minute?

- Nothing comes to mind. It was a pretty easy yes for me, Harry, 'cause I just saw the value like easily, and I was like, "Okay, I can easily see the value in this." So there wasn't much of a fence for me. Like I was always on board.

- Nice, man! So thank you by the way, that's awesome. So would you recommend others work with us?

- 100%, yep, yeah! And if you guys, if anybody is looking for help on optimizing their sales process, on the pre-sales process, on putting some systems in place, on how to get better in those areas, really recommend Harry.

- Thank you, man, that's amazing! That's awesome! So who do you think is like a really ideal fit for me? Do you have any thoughts on that?

- Maybe somebody that feels like, I would say somebody that feels like they're leaving money on the table on the sales side of things. Like, even if it's a little bit, you probably don't even know how much you're leaving on the table guys. And also if you think that your offer could be improved, then I would I be talking to Harry, 'cause that was a game changer no doubt. I mean, those two things, if you have any questions at all about those two, and you're even like thinking there could be an issue there, I would talk to Harry.

- And I love it. I mean, but even on that second point, did you think that your offer could be improved, or did it really kind of take me like telling you that hence convincing you?

- That's a good point, yeah!

- I didn't even really realize that until we started working together, how much could be improved. So, yeah, most people think their offers are spot on. I thought mine was, and we made some big changes, but it's like now when I'm on these calls, people's eyes are opening literally on these calls, so-

- The positioning changes are big, but like in terms of your service delivery and like what you're focusing on, it's not massive what you've changed?

- No, not at all, not at all. We've changed very little, but the way that we've positioned the service, people are like just opening their eyes to what we're doing and they get the picture painted a lot better.

- Nice, man!

- So it's been helpful.

- So if someone's on the fence right now, why should they take action?

- There's no reason not to. I mean, if you implement this stuff that you're talking about out, Harry, I mean, at least with me, when it comes to the offer with sales, I mean, there's just no reason not to.

- The ROI is pretty immediate.

- The ROI, it was instant. I mean, we optimized the offer in like a week guys, and then eyes were opening like that week, and closes we're coming in at 6K, you know? And then on like the sales interviews, that took like a week guys, and I was getting inbound leads right after I posted them. So it took a week or two and it just made drastic improvements to the business. So, I mean, if you guys are looking for swift improvements with action, I mean, talk to Harry for sure.

- Awesome, man. Well, thank you so much. Well, Charlie, this has been great. Anything else you wanna add?

- Just thanks, Harry, like I really appreciate, I really appreciate the past, and man, we've only been working for 30 days together, which is crazy.

- More to come, more to come!

- Yeah, yeah, but I appreciate you, man. And thanks so much.

- I appreciate you as well. And like it really does, like, I'm so stoked when I get like a message from you or any of my client is like, "Hey, I just closed this." Or whatever that has happened, And I'm looking forward to continue to work with you, so it's gonna be great. What if people wanna learn more about you and your business, how can they find more about you online?

- Yeah, sure. So you guys, I spend most of my time on Facebook, it's where you can best find me, so you can friend me on Facebook. And then I also have the Facebook group you guys can check out, which is called Marketing Success for Accountants and Bookkeepers.

- Amazing, man! All right, cool. Well, thank you so much and we'll talk soon, all right?

- All right, thanks Harry, I appreciate you, man.

- Bye!

- Bye!
