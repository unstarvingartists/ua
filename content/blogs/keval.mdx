- All right. Three, two, one. Everybody, Harry Whelchel here. Today I have Keval from London, United Kingdom. We're gonna be talking about how Keval got his first high ticket sale and client in about 45 days, all while in university as well, yourself, studying?

- Yup.

- Nice man. All right, so why don't we, I turn it over to you, can you just briefly introduce yourself and share a little bit more about what you do?

- Yeah, so I'm a 2nd year student, at King's College in London. And through how, yeah, so we worked on helping, so I was helping students getting into university, top universities in the UK. Helping them study better and be more productive and yeah, just helping them with the application and everything. And yeah, that's how it's going so far.

- Awesome, man. Awesome. So like, who in particular do you help? So it sounds like high school students?

- Yup. High school students, secondary school students, 16 or 17. And, yeah. So year 12 and year 13.

- Awesome, and how long have you been doing it?

- So for now it's been 40, 45 days.

- Just getting started?

- Started, yeah. And already seeing amazing.

- Awesome man, awesome. So what do you think, like what drew you to helping these types of folks?

- So I, myself, when I was applying to university, I didn't really know, kind of how to have the best application, what universities wanted. And also studying-wise, I was studying hours and hours, and then some of my friends would study less, maybe only a couple of hours. And I was wondering, what's the difference? And then I know it's like, yeah. And then I was like, maybe I've, I went through the process and then I got a place at a really good university in the UK. And I thought I could help other students with exactly the same problems I had. And yeah, that's kind of how it came about. Okay with all of that.

- And what do you think if, you know, I bet there's a ton to it, but like at a high level, what are, what are the key things kind of to preparing for college applications and studying well?

- There's really only two things. It was getting the grades, getting excellent grades. And also having a really strong application. So having extracurriculars, like work experience and knowledge of that field. So yeah, so I help people with getting good grades, and also in less time, so being productive. Learning efficiently and effectively. And then having a really good application.

- Nice, nice. That's awesome. So what are some, what are some techniques, for being more efficient with your time, and studying and things like that?

- Yeah. So it'd be, for example, using active recall spaced repetition time-blocking, 'cause most students just take notes and write down notes and read through it. It's actually kind of getting that knowledge out, then maybe even teaching it to someone else, just matters like that. And then also, with finding that experience, being able to network, being able to communicate effectively, and build relationships and connections in a particular field. And then yeah, land an internship or work experience for a couple of weeks, which will be good. Then, the personal statement, which is kind of like that essay they use, to get into university.

- Nice. Okay, very cool. Very cool. So what do you think makes you guys in particular unique, when it comes to helping high schoolers, with studying in college prep?

- So, most chooses nowadays just are subject specific. So for example, economics, maths, they'll teach them all the knowledge. But most schools, especially in the UK, they give you all the support, all the knowledge, all the textbooks and everything, But they don't really show you how to kind of absorb this information, retain it, and how to study amongst other activities and everything. That's what I was helping students with. And also, this school has so many students to help with, especially with application. They don't really get one-to-one guidance, and supports with application, writing it all out, communicating efficiently and effectively, conveying points really well. So that's what I was helping students with as well. And they didn't really get that support elsewhere.

- Awesome man, awesome. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. So, you have, like your, a lot of your strategy and tactics are more general and can be applied across different topics that they may have to study and prepare for.

- Yeah, all subjects and all levels, really. Yeah

- Cool. Very, very cool. So let's go back kind of at the beginning, before we were working together, maybe like a month or two before that, kind of, what were you doing at that time before you started working with me?

- So I was just focusing on getting good, great spot, which was just a smaller element of the bigger picture. And I was trying to find clients, going through different means, but I didn't really have really that much direction. I didn't really know what works and what doesn't work. And how'd, you really build relationships with people who actually want this service and actually want help with this. And yeah, I was also targeting all types of students, so it hadn't really honed down on a specific kind of avatar, ideal clients. Kind of just like throwing spaghetti on a wall and just kind of seeing what sticks and like nothing really sticking.

- Had you tried to get leads yet or anything like that?

- From before, I hadn't had any leads, and hadn't had any strategy sessions either.

- Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay so, were you trying to generate leads yet? Or were you just kind of like still in planning mode?

- I was, I'd done all the planning and everything, I was actually trying, so. I was trying to go through Facebook, trying to build connections and everything. But I wasn't really sure what to do, and how to go about doing it. And yeah.

- Okay. Cool. Were you trying anything else other than Facebook,

- Facebook. At that time? No, just Facebook, that I use. Yeah.

- Any, like, did you have any, like, so what, were you doing mostly like kind of organic outreach, like pitching people, are you going to Facebook groups? Like what were you doing on Facebook?

- Yeah so before I was, going to Facebook groups, adding just a bunch of people in the group. And then some people would accept, somebody in, and the people that would accept I would just try and kind of just shoot them a message saying, "Oh, I do this. Would you like help on this?" And normally people would reply. And the people that would reply couldn't really seem that interested on getting onto a call. And yeah. So that's kind of how it was going about before.

- Like, so, how was that experience, Was it, was it frustrating at all? Or like, was it, you're thinking, "oh, like this must be just sales." Like this is just really hard, and if I just keep doing it, eventually someone will come through.

- It was super frustrating, because I put so many hours into it, every day I would wake up really early, and just do as much as possible, until Facebook would like actually limit me. Day in, day out and just seeing the results. And then also seeing other people who are seeing results in the same thing. I was like, what am I doing wrong? Is it my niche? What is it? I wasn't really able to identify the problem. And that was like really annoying.

- Yup. Got it. Got it. Yeah. It's a, it's hard. It's really hard to tell. Like I remember when I was starting out, like sometimes you think, oh, well maybe I know, like starting a business is supposed to be hard, so maybe this is just hard, and like it's gonna work eventually, but it's, it's so, it's like so ambiguous, you don't really know, is it something I'm doing wrong? Or it's just the way it is, you know?

- Yeah, because I have no experience in business 'cause I'm a student myself. So I wasn't really sure how it should be, going about, doing it. What kind of works was a good indication that I'm on the right path.

- Yup.

- Things like that. Yeah.

- Yup. So where did you first hear about me?

- It was through, I think it was through a referral, and also through a Facebook group. Yeah

- And like, yeah. So, the referral was Jawad, right? But yeah.

- How do you tell each other?

- He targeted students as well. And he looked like he was having amazing success. So I think I sent him a message, some time ago saying, "do you have any help?" Like, "I'm not making any progress." And then we jumped on a call. He said, "you're doing amazing stuff." And I remember I went through your profile, you had loads of interviews, so I knew you'd help tons of people and see results. So then that's when we started getting in touch.

- Okay. Cool, very cool. And so yeah. What peaked your interest in what Jawad had to say and what you saw kind of initially with me?

- It was the fact that he was going through so many groups. 'cause I remember going through groups and seeing him there, and his strategy was completely different to mine. So I knew kind of he knew what he was saying. And you also had really good results, and I hadn't had any at that time. So that was like, was, I was like kind of wondering, like, what am I doing wrong? What's he doing right? And yeah.

- Nice, nice. That's cool. That's, that's interesting that you guys are, I guess you're, you're doing different problems, different offers, but serving similar markets, and that he was willing to like get on a call with you, and like talk to you and give you some advice. That's pretty cool.

- Really helped. We spoke, I was trying to get as much information out and try and learn as much as possible. And he said like you're the go-to guy. So I think, I'm not sure if you send me a message, or if I sent you a message, but yeah, it was great.

- I think he introduced, if I remember. Yeah. In messenger.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, so like, walk me through. All right, so it's been about 45 days since we worked together. Can you speak to maybe like one or two high-level things that's really helped you that we've done together? You know, since we got started.

- So first it was, hunting and farming, getting, building these relationships, people, kind of how to do it the way to, then also the sales scripts for me was really helpful. Kind of being able to go through, how kind of, to structure everything and speak correctly and convey, convey the points in the best way possible. That really helped. And yeah, it was mainly those two things which are really great.

- So how many of you had a number of quick chats and strategy sessions now?

- Quick chats. I think I've had about around 10, maybe 8 to 10.

- And strategies, I had, I think it was about four or five. Yeah.

- Cool, cool. So how did you get in touch with the, the client that you're working with now? What, what, where did they come in through?

- So it was through, it was through an app, a neighborhood app in the UK called Nextdoor, and I use the same process. So it was still the same things you taught, just on a different platform, which was really good. We built the relationship and everything, and then I got them onto a call and followed your advice, and everything, your sales scripts, which works amazingly and yeah, that's how I got the client.

- Okay. Yeah. Well, so what, let's dig into this some. So Nextdoor, we have it here in the US, it's like a local forum, you know, it kinda, they're kind of like Facebook groups, but they're around like local topics and things like that. So were you in some sort of like forum or group on Nextdoor, and that's where you got connected?

- And so, I just made a post on it, saying I provide these services, if you're looking for help, just shoot me a message.

- Great.

- And yeah, someone just contacted me.

- Okay. And then, is there like a direct message function on Nextdoor?

- No. So I left my number at the bottom of the post, and then she just texted me, and we just followed through from there.

- And then at that point you just texted back and forth. Okay, and then got them, got it. Okay. Cool. So, as you advance them through that point, quick chat strategy sessions. Any interesting, like takeaways or aha moments for you in that process?

- It was mainly the sales call. Just everything I would say , they would get more and more excited, and willing to like, really just get on boards as soon as possible. I would say something and then another thing, and then there'll be like, "oh my God, this is perfect." That was like, wow, this is amazing.

- That's so cool. Okay. Very, very cool. Yeah. So you, you could, like, you could feel them getting more and more sold through the conversation, on the plan you were putting forward, you all that stuff.

- Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

- So we don't have to get into pricing if you don't want to, either way is fine, but like in terms of actually getting them to buy, was there a lot of resistance or was it, you know, they basically said yes, pretty quickly.

- They said yes, straight away. because obviously, I'm a student, I've never charged such prices before.

- Yeah. As I said the pricing, they were onboard, they said, "yeah, that's reasonable and we're happy to transfer it."

- And so they paid on the call, in full?

- It was just straight after the call, I just dropped my bank details and they made the transfer.

- How did it feel?

- It felt amazing. Probably what an amazing experience. Just knowing that like, I can provide a service, especially at this age, that can, that is actually worth something. And then someone would be willing to pay for it, which I never thought would be possible.

- Yep. It's like, I, I talk a lot with you guys about like milestones and stuff. So it's like, whenever you hit these milestones, it's not even about goals. It's like, I feel like getting your first client is a bigger milestone than getting your first 10, because if, once you get one, you're like, oh, I can do that 5 or 10 more times. Like it just, it becomes, you become so confident, you know?

- For sure, exactly. Yeah.

- That's awesome. So, what, what's kind of next for you? Like, what do you have on deck for the next, like three to four weeks planned?

- So, I'm still working with students, and maybe solving other problems that they are having, not just getting into university. Maybe communication, skills, confidence, things like that. And following the same principles and everything, and yeah, just working through that.

- Okay. So, so we got this new client, and obviously we need to work with them, and get them results. So we're gonna have that going. Are you planning on like continue to lead gen, and bring in a couple more clients? You know, as well?

- I was thinking of, I was thinking of doing that. And then also I thought, maybe there's also bigger problems that students have, besides just getting into university. So I was thinking that might be worth exploring. So we'll kind of just see kind of just test what works, and go with that, really.

- Yeah. So it sounds like you're still trying to hone in on exactly what you want to offer, which is totally fine. You're just getting started, But I would yeah, I would keep on the message that you have right now, keep on the current offer, and then just do a lot of quick chats. And then you can kind of see through the quick chats, what, whether you need to expand it, tweak it, tune it. But the fact that someone's bought, that's a really good sign. It's like resist the temptation of just like changing things, you know, because you can. Yup, yeah. And maybe there's more to Nextdoor. Maybe, maybe there's other ways you can better leverage that. Anyway. That's neither here nor there. So have any other areas of your life personally, professionally, improved?

- Mainly the confidence, just knowing that, I'm able to this able to work, I'm able to have a consultancy --

- Hey, Keval, can you hear me? The internet is going in and out. Let me.

- Yeah, can you hear me?

- I'm gonna change my network real quick and see if this fixes it. All right. So we just had some network connectivity issues. We'll see if this is any better. So Keval, I was just asking you about, you know, were there any other areas of your life personally, professionally, that improved from working with me?

- Yeah. So firstly, the confidence, knowing, knowing I'm able to start a business, that I can actually get money and can land clients, just knowing that, made me feel amazing. And also, otherwise being a student and living in London, having to pay tuition fees and accommodation fees, and being able to work and have a reliable way, way source of income which is amazing, it's amazing. And is literally just what I needed as a student. So yeah. So both really aspects, both personal and kind of financial and yeah, aspects of everybody.

- That's awesome, man. Dude, I'm so excited for you. This is great. It's really good that you're learning this stuff at such a young age. It will pay dividends over a very long time. What, so going back to kind of us, our, our conversation, initial conversation, our sales call, why did you decide to do business with me?

- So firstly, it was because I saw two testimonials of yours. It was Jawad's and I think Ria's, and both of them were students working in the student niche and I had never seen anyone working there, and seen results, such amazing results. And through working with you, they saw amazing results. I think when you kind of knew what you were doing, and you give really good advice often, kind of that's what really sparked my interest.

- Okay. And was there anything that really kicked you over the fence? So to speak at the, at the end?

- I would say mainly those two things. And also your method of getting clients predictably and then closing them as well.

- Cool. Okay, awesome. So would you recommend others work with me?

- For sure, a 100%. With a consultancy business and getting clients predictably. In that case then I would definitely recommend, recommend you.

- Thanks, man. I appreciate that. Who, who do you think in particular I'm a good fit for?

- Let's say anyone just looking to scale up, get more clients, predictably. And really also refine that offer, and what service they're providing. Because I remember before I was kind of, I wasn't really sure about what to offer, and was kind of needed. But you gave me a lot of clarity on that, which is good.

- Awesome. So why should someone listening, take action right now?

- Just to make the most progress as soon as possible and not wasting your time. Because there's so much potential to learn and grow. I would say just kind of to make most of that opportunity, as soon as possible.

- Excellent. Excellent. That makes a ton of sense. So Keval, this has been fantastic, man. I'm really excited to see what you do in the next month or two. Just two more questions for you. So my last question is, you know. What is your number one piece of advice for other coaches and consultants?

- I would say you just keep at it. Because I know for me, the first couple of months, I didn't really see many results. I was kind of struggling by myself, and I just say not to give up and just to keep going at it, and try new things and just going through trial and error, and kind of seeing what works, what doesn't work, and just keep at it.

- Awesome. Awesome. So if people wanna learn more about you, where can they find out more about you online?

- They could. If you type in my name, Keval into Facebook, they'll be able to find my name. I didn't have a website just yet, but I'll be looking into kind of getting one and yeah.

- Cool. Awesome, man. Well, thank you so much.

- Thank you.

- All right. Talk soon.

- Bye.

- Bye.
