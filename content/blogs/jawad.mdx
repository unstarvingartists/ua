- Right. Three, two, one. Everybody, Harry Whelchel here. We are back with Jawad S. of kreutz.uk. Jawad helps international students in the UK land computing jobs on visa sponsorships. And we are back celebrating in the second month working together he landed two clients, £5,000 total and yeah, Jawad thanks for coming back on to share more about some of these wins.

- Hey Harry. Yeah, great to be here again.

- Cool man. So let's just go back through like the last month, like walk us through kind of what led to those clients coming onboard.

- Yeah, so June has been a really interesting month. It's been obviously a few weeks since we started working together at that time and I was like trying to really hone down my sales process. So we got the lead gen sold. Lead gen is no longer a struggle, which was a huge struggle for me before.

- How did you know it's not a struggle anymore? Like what are some tangible metrics around that?

- Yeah. So a quick giveaway is really the number of messages that I have in my inbox on Facebook, you know? Before it was like doing content all week, all week content and trying to do outreach and barely like 10 or 15 messages and most of them aren't even interested. I'm just trying too hard to get those people engaged. But now with the hunting and farming, 30 to 40 messages every week. After the weekend or Monday, I have to work until 11:00 PM to go through all of the messages and just try to get people ready, to get on calls. And so, yeah, this is really the giveaway the number of people messaging and who are genuinely interested has massively changed. So this is what tells me that lead gen is no longer a problem because the more I go into the hunting farming, I know I can put two hours a day and then tomorrow I'm gonna get this summer of messages in my inbox.

- How many, like, just ballpark like on one of your best weeks, like how many strategy sessions a week are you having now?

- So the top, the record week was 10 strategy sessions, which was one of the weeks in June, And on that week, that's when I really realized that okay, so you know...

- Something has changed.

- Yeah, shit just got real basically. We no longer struggle with the lead gen. It's time to focus on the sales and really try to convert those sales into paying clients. And...

- Do you feel like... Do you feel like now, like you could do 10 strategy sessions at will a week if you want to just have to do activities to make that happen?

- Yeah. Yeah. I'm fairly confident that I can do a 10 strategy session week again. But I'm just taking it easy because I wanna improve the delivery of sales. So now averaging on five to six strategy sessions, but I can definitely do 10 strategy sessions if I want to. Because I see the effort that I need to put and I know how much effort I need to put in order to get that.

- I love it, man. Anything else before we move on and like any interesting insights or takeaways about lead gen that might be helpful to someone listening right now?

- Yeah, I think there's a very interesting point that just came up when I was talking to a . So we were talking about like Facebook groups and sometimes coming across people that seem a bit threatening to you, or you feel like, "oh, do those people need my help? "I don't think I can add any value in this room." or "I don't think I can help these people." And from my perspective, I've been through this so many times and I've talked to you about this. You know, and you don't wanna judge people this way. And the big thing for me was really believing that anyone at any point in time can come for help. Before, one of my beliefs was that like either Leeds students or Russell Group students, they don't need my help because they have good universities and good support. But then like three or four leads in the past couple of weeks, they came to me from those universities. And I'm like, you know, working with top level university students right now because actually those people might have so many stuff available to them, but they they're just like struggling with that small thing, that just needs that one little push. And if you're out there in the groups and if you're out there talking to these people, you will be able to find these people. And these are really the best people to work with.

- Interesting. So it's not only that the volume of activity is increasing. You've had some mindset shifts, some changes in your patterns where it's allowing you to see and get in touch with people that are probably super ambitious, intelligent, easier to help, and they want help and they've got budget.

- Yeah, yeah. So the paradigm is a massive sort of thing in this because before I used to think, 'oh, you know, I'm only getting like these types of people and these types of leads who don't need help." But the way you look at it changes the way you behave with the niche, and then the way you behave attracts the people who are right for you. Who are serious, as you said, you know, and got the budget and you got the motivation as well.

- I love it, man. All right. So what else has been...you've been working on?

- So, yeah, in terms of the strategy sessions, we really, you know, honing down on the sales and Monday on the 22nd of June was my birthday. And I closed two clients,

- Happy birthday.

- On that day. So that was like the best birthday present ever to make £5,000 during that day signing up two clients. And that, at that point I knew that, you know, delivering the sale in this particular way is really the key, because before it was like a huge bottleneck. I was like doing a lot of strategy sessions and no, no, no, no, no. You know, and people were haggling on the price and things like that. People saying all kinds of objections and sometimes are, you know, superficial objections. I'm not gonna say bullshit because, you know, the prospect is never bullshitting, but it's something that they're not vocalizing.

- Smoke screen.

- Mhh?

- A smoke screen.

- Yeah. So it was always kind of these smoke screen objections. And I realized my delivery of the sales strategy session was really the reason for this. And it wasn't really the prospect.

- Yeah. It's amazing to watch you. Like, what's so cool about sales is as you're doing this and you're doing the calls and you're getting further and further and closer to the yes and the buy, you're like in slow motion, seeing how, like, what you're doing is not... is causing them to want to say yes. And then as you like slowly walk down and you fix one thing and you fix the next thing. And then it's like, okay, then they buy, you're like, "whoa" like,

- It's just, it's so humbling, you know?

- It is. And it's really fascinating because at this point you can see how the power law works. You know, you can see that one yes can mean maybe 10 yesses after this if you do things the right way. And you can see that one prospect that you might've judged in the past and said, you know, this person, I dunno, unlikely, they will sign up. You might've judged them in the Facebook group or in the chat and you're like, "yeah, I don't know about this." And then they turn out to be like the most motivated, most urgent client who wants to work with you and get started.

- Nice. Yep, totally. So tell me more about, like, what was different about the pricing in terms of the people you've recently brought on compared with the pricing in terms of past people you've worked with.

- Right. So for people who I signed in February before we started working together, I wasn't really sure. You know, I was just like taking stabs in the dark and see how things are gonna work with the my niche. And the two people I signed up, I gave him like an open-ended plan to help them find a job. And I charged them, initially my price point was 2000 and they haggled me down to 1000. I was like, "yeah, what the heck? "You know, let's just do it." And so, so they started, we started working together. But as I progressed, I started to see that, you know, this is kind of a draining sort of thing and they don't really see the value in my work as well because it's open-ended, you know, there's no limit on time and they feel like they're gonna have me at their disposal the whole time. Which funny enough, they were never utilizing me enough to make real progress. So that was the initial offer. But then with the new offer, having a set amount of time and, you know, a 12-week duration at a much higher price point, which is 3000, and I'm aiming to take that to four or 5,000 soon, this is a, to me, this was an exponential shift in terms of the value. And now the people who I signed up, they already see... I already see how they are valuing the work that we're doing together and they're like, always on top of the actions I need to do. So it was a massive shift between these two offers.

- Got it. Okay, got it. And so, I apologize if you said this, but one of the things I was...that came purview for me was like the new pricing was like, I guess it's triple. Two or three times as much as you've ever charged somebody before.

- Yeah. Yeah. So the first couple of clients they were £1000 each. Now one client is £3000. So this is really the new price point for a set duration of time, 12 weeks of time, which even gave me clarity, you know. It gave me confidence and clarity that, okay, this is the duration of time that we're gonna work on and this is how much it's gonna cost. And people take it much more... people are taking me much more seriously when positioning the offer in that way.

- Do you feel like it changes at all your like psychological commitment to getting them results?

- Absolutely. There's also a big element of this. That's also a good point. Obviously, it's been subconscious to me. But come to think about it, 100%. Because this is a crucial part of the quality of work that you're doing together. So if we set a set duration of time, it's kind of a commitment from me that, yeah, typically this is usually the time it takes for you to start getting results. So it's a commitment for both parties.

- I like it. So how, like when you made those two sales, how did it feel personally? Did anything like kinda switched? Did you like feeling like, oh, this is a new chapter that's about to start?

- Yeah. When I made those sales it's... I mean every time you make sales, like this is different, you know, this is it. This is getting real. Things are gonna be different moving forward. To me, the first thing that I realized that you know, if I get two or three clients like this every month, I am set, I'm making six figures in my business. And that's how easy it can be. Before I used to try and think to the future and I'm like, "okay, I wanna grow a six figure business, "but I have no idea how it's gonna happen." You know? If I work with my clients like £500 pounds a month, how many clients do I need to get? 10, 15 clients? I need to be signing 15 clients a month, holy molly! You know, that's a lot of work. So to me, the vision to the future was really fizzy. And it was, it was fuzzy. And I wasn't really sure how I'm gonna be able to get six figures in my business. But when you make that sale at that price point, it completely shifts your paradigm in terms of the way you're looking at the future. Because now everything you have thought, every everything that I have thought is gonna be a lot of trouble, it can actually be achieved very easily.

- That's it man. You nailed it. I mean to me, it's like, once you sell somebody at that price point or higher, who's a good fit that you know you can help and it's gonna be fun and a joy to help them, then you're like, oh, like the mist is gone. It's just like, I just have to...the path is in front of me, I just have to walk it. You know?

- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's kind of... It's like a game when you kind of load the next level so you can see the next level and you just need to get to that achievement. And yeah. And also... to your point, you know, charging at that price point and more, you can easily see that there's, you know, makes total sense that I'm charging this much. I mean, how did I sign those clients at a very low price point like this? Because it can give her the transformation that we're doing with them. It makes perfect sense. And it's only fair that you have this first one or even more and you think about ways how you can make this more valuable but also more profitable for your business.

- Nice man. So what's on deck for you in the next 30 to 90 days? Business-wise.

- Yeah. So business-wise really kind of doubling on the achievements that I've had this month. July or July I wanna be able to close two more ideal client personas, you know, Arabic speaking, computing, people interested in computing or technology or STEM. Really want to make sure that the, you know, I'm kind of in the zone and resonating really well with my niche and having that focus so I can get at least two or three more clients at that price point. And then at this point, I'm very confident, you know. And I can really kind of rapture that up and just to do more of that and keep on improving really. It's all about making the pipeline more efficient because right now I see a lot of rooms for improvement in the pipeline and just like keeping on improving that for the next month.

- Do you see any...I love that. I think all that makes sense. What about like in the business, like service delivery? How important is it to get good results for these first folks?

- I think it's very important because those clients can get you many more clients. So this is not something that you've told me actually. But this is your business, this is what you do. You help people get clients by... through the help of their successful clients. When I first told my brother about the news, when I closed those two clients, he was like, "this is it man. "You gotta leave everything and you gotta deliver results "for these clients because that's what's gonna help you "get more people on board and that's just gonna help you improve, you know, your business works." And yeah, there's certainly a lot of focus on that. It's not pressure, but it's definitely a priority as well, like delivering results. We are already doing so. I'm very happy with the progress I'm doing with one of those clients. So, you know, we're really kind of streamlining things and making things move forward. So yeah.

- I love it. Yeah, it's I mean, it's the one longterm sustainable competitive advantage. Like, do you get clients results? And do you document them and share that? That's it, you know?

- Yeah. And it's a timeless thing. It's always gonna be true. It's always gonna be the thing that will help you attract people. Like actually to your, you know, to what we were discussing, one of the biggest transformations as well is how you get the confidence from those prospects. You know, when getting on the strategy session if people don't know who you are and don't know how you work with these clients and if they haven't seen those case studies, it's gonna be massively more difficult to close at the end. And that's part why I was struggling with those nine or 10 strategy sessions. I was talking to people, they have no idea who I am. And I was like, you know, trying to close so hard by the end of the call. And if I go back and listen to those, I was like, there's no way this person was gonna sign up. What am I doing, you know? So yeah.

- Don't beat yourself up there 'cause it takes... it takes like a couple of people who are really warm. You're like, "oh, so this is what a real deep feels like." And you don't know it beforehand.

- No, I don't beat myself up. But it's always valuable lessons, you know? That's how you learn and you wouldn't have learned otherwise. And if someone is warm, they're basically closed from at the beginning of the strategy session. Makes your work so much easier if someone has been exposed to your marketing and your, you know, your case studies or anything like this, it makes the work so much smoother on the strategy session.

- Yep. So what is like, in terms of our relationship, in what ways have I been helpful to you over the last month? Yeah, can you speak to some of that?

- I think the biggest thing for me is being part of the community and like, you know, we did have one to ones and I really enjoyed our chats and conversations. We talked about so many valuable stuff in my business but now like just being part of this community where I have other people. Like with the same mindset and it's even like quiet niche because those are people technical like me, some of them are interested in technology, even the guy who is doing the arts, I'm really interested in arts, you know? I love art and I find like every single person in that community really interesting. And so getting to see how they are progressing in the journey is so much valuable and also being able to connect with them and practice with them as well, that's really valuable to me. But also getting the support in the group from you on every single aspect of the offer, you know, lead gen, quick chats, strategy sessions, whatever, that's been massively helpful as well.

- Nice man. Really glad to hear it. I'm glad it's been cool to see the community kind of form so quickly, like people helping each other, practicing with each other. So much activity happening in the group. And it's like very vibrant and in-depth questions that people are asking each other and stuff. It's really cool.

- Yeah. It's fascinating to see it come together this way and we are being part of it, you know, we're witnessing it and when we are being part of it. So it's really great to be part of that.

- Nice man. So would you recommend others work with me?

- Absolutely. If they want to, you know, get crystal clear on their business and offer and really be able to scale, I mean, whatever is the problem, I would definitely...or the challenge, it's, I mean, look at it like, this interview, the community, it's a no brainer. To me when I spoke to you, I was like, you know, this guy, he's done it for himself, these are the current results, that's what I want for myself. And it's a no brainer. If all of that is in front of you, it's a no-brainer not to get help from you with that.

- Yep. I appreciate that. So, you know, now, like two months in. I know I've already asked you some of these questions, but I'd love to hear again, like where you're at now? Who do you think...give me the day where you're at? Who do you think we're a good fit for?

- Right now?

- Like given that...

- Like in terms of your services?

- Yeah. Given that you've work with me a little bit longer, has your thoughts on who we're a good fit for changed or evolved at all? Like just kind of speak to that where you're currently at now.

- I think I found it really fascinating how you positioned your business to be focused on technical people who are not interested during like a Silicon Valley type of startup way but they're more interested in consulting but they're struggling with that. And to me, this was a really sensitive thing for me. Because I had people in my social circle who, you know, we have the same interests, we are so much aligned in terms of interests, we want to have our own businesses, we're techies, we're technical. But also we, we are kind of extroverted introverts or vice-versa and he chose to go down the startup route. And to me, looking at that, and I was like, "maybe I should have explored that." You know, "maybe I should have done it that way." And like trying to get investments and things like that. But to me, I always believed in the consulting side of things and I always wanted to do it this way. Because ever since I started the journey, seeing, you know, seeing the people who have achieved that, and I was like, you know, "why the hell can't I achieve that for myself this way?" And it feels like it really resonates with me. And so I always worked with...was trying really hard to make it work and to a point where I started doubting myself and then we started working together and I found it really helpful that you have come from the same background and now you are actually tailoring this to people who have this sort of background in this journey. And I think this is really helpful.

- Nice, man. That makes a ton of sense. So if someone is on the fence right now, listening, why should they take action right now?

- I mean, let's face it, you wouldn't have chosen to get into the business because you like to mull things over. If you like to mull things over, it's not gonna be a great journey in business. Like if you feel there's an issue in your business that you need to fix, then there's probably is. And people who have a business, they know it. It's like their child, you know. You're trying to grow your business and you know something is not working out and, you know, you're on the fence whether to get help or not, definitely get help. Because sometimes it's just like one small thing that someone brings your attention to that's gonna help you explode your business. And to me, it was really the case. And I thought before like it's, you know, you have to do it on your own. Like, you don't have to ask for help, just try and do it on your own, look at those other people. But then I realized that those other people have always gotten help from, you know, the people who succeeded like Sam Ovens or whatever. If you go in their story, you know, they always got help in every step of their journey. So there's no shame in getting help from people.

- Yeah, that resonates with me like, I think everyone struggles with that. I know like I did personally. Like, I think there's this attitude of like, "oh, entrepreneurship is supposed to be hard." Like, you just need to have grit and just stick with it. And I think a lot of people will do that and they'll go a long time and they're so determined and they're so gritty that they could have saved themselves six months, nine months, a year if they just raised their hand and asked for help. But they were like too proud or whatever. And what I'm saying, they, I mean, like I'm speaking about myself. Like I wish I had asked for help earlier in my career. I think a lot of people struggle with that.

- I would say the same man. I've been trying to, you know, I've been trying too hard since 2018 like with the consulting journey. And I was like, "yeah, I invest in this course, that's really enough." And I just wanna try and do it on my own. But you know, sometimes we need that extra bit of support and if you try too hard on your own, you're gonna hate it eventually. And that's really not a healthy position to be in. So getting that help, getting that inspiration from others and saying that, you know, it's possible, I mean, my relationship with you, you've worked... personally, you are an inspiration for me because when I look at the results that you are making, if you've made like 20 grand in April, I'm like, "you know, there's nothing stopping me "from achieving that for myself.' And this thing alone is really enough for anyone to invest in being part of the community. You know, not mentioning any of the other stuff. Just the inspiration alone.

- Nice man. Nice. So what is your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants right now?

- I would say I'll be seeing a lot of people who have done, you know, have kind of been in the same position that I was about a few weeks ago. Like, you know, talking about the niche, this niche, I don't know, they don't have the money, you know, they're not closing the strategy sessions, it's such a struggle to hook these people...

- Where's the quality leads...

- No quality leads, not enough leads, these sort of things, always look at yourself first. Sometimes it might be something in the niche, but nine times out of 10, it's gonna be... your business

- I'm laughing 'cause its so true. This is such a big insight for people to say, "yeah, like, yep, you nailed it." Don't look at external, like first look internal.

- Exactly. It's like a human zoo. We're looking at Mars, you know, we're going out to Mars and no one's looking at earth and how to conserve it. It's the human nature always looking outside. But nine times out of 10, the solution is inside. Look at your own business, look at your own self, like your personnel. Sometimes people don't even like the way you're talking to them. You probably need to look into that because I have personally experienced that. With some of like my prospects, you know? I realized, "oh, maybe, you know, I should have "done that conversation in a different way." And it's totally fine. But if you look at yourself and try to improve that, then your niche is gonna, you know, change massively.

- Yeah. That's such a good insight I appreciate you sharing that. That's a really good one. So cool. So if people want to learn more about you and your story, how can I find out more about you online?

- Yeah. So they can find me on Facebook, LinkedIn and jawadsabra.com. Yeah.

- Great. Well, Jawad, thank you so much man, for sharing this quick update with us. Really excited for you and I just can't wait to see what happens in the next month or two.

- Thanks man. Me too. Great chatting with you today.

- Alright, peace talk soon.

- Bye.

- Bye.

- Three, two, one. Hey everyone. Harry Whelchel here. Today, I have Jawad S. and we're gonna be talking about how he generated 12 quick chats and five strategy sessions with ideal clients in the last 30 days. But before we get into that, I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. Jawad, why don't I pass it over to you. Can you just briefly introduce yourself and share a little bit more about what you do?

- Yeah, so Jawad, I came to the UK as an international student myself and I've been working in the UK for the past six years in the technology industry as a tech consultant. And I started my consulting business recently to help international students find work here in the UK, particularly in the computing industry and the technology space.

- Awesome, awesome. So, how long have you been doing that?

- So this is something that I started last year in 2019. I did some work in recruitment before and some work in recruitment marketing as well. But the focus on international students we started doing this around mid-2019. We also did some boot camps to help people get into computing and programming and off the back of that, I decided, you know, I wanna focus on helping international students because their problem is much more painful and the transition they need to do, it's much more profound because they need work visas to work in the UK and being able to be hired by companies, that takes a lot of effort. So yeah. We started doing that in late 2019 until now.

- Cool. So what do you think... is there anything that makes you guys different or unique in terms of approaching this problem, helping international students get these jobs in the UK?

- Yeah, so that's a very good question because this niche it's quite niche in nature, you know? There isn't a lot of career coaches out there that are focused, particularly on international students. Like you, you know, you might go and find a lot of career coaches that help people get jobs or like progress in their career. But in terms of the international student niche, there's only a handful of people doing this in the UK right now or companies. And the typical approach they follow is more about the graduate schemes and the graduate rules, route, which is, you know, you gotta prepare for the interviews and the assessment and it's quite focused on the language and the interview side of things. But the way we do things is a bit different because we lead with building connections and we try to make... we help international students realize that the decision which the companies are making is really about you and your character and whether or not you're a good fit to be with the company. Because the visa part and the sponsorship part is only part of the equation and it's not really the biggest thing. Because one, the employer makes a decision on the person. They want hire them, they will do whatever it takes to hire that person. They need visa or whatever. So, and that decision is made from an emotional place. You know, if they see you, they see that you're eager, they see that you're a good fit to be with the team and they like the skills and what you have to bring to the table, they will say, "yes, that's, you know, that's it, "we wanna have you on board." And that's really the transformation that we help our students achieve to become that person.

- Got it. And that seems like a really unique insight that just you help them focus on their character, how they position themselves, like a lot of soft skills. And then if you do all of that, the administrative logistics around getting visas and things like that becomes a lot easier. Is that kinda what you're saying?

- Yeah. So it's basically a five step process. You know, we start off by helping them find the focus and then working on their candidate presence, you know, their profile and then building connections with employers and the right way to really do the job search and then finally doing well in interviews and accelerating their career.

- Nice. Nice. So, Jawad, I'd love to like, if you don't mind, like, I'd love to learn more about your story first. Do you mind sharing a little bit about your journey? Like how you decided to go to school in the UK and what that was like?

- Yeah. So it's an interesting story, you know, because it's a journey, you know, and it wasn't easy. When I was applying to become a student here, a lot of people in my country, a lot of people said it's not possible, you know? It's, you ain't gonna get a student visa and even if you get a student visa, you can't really work in the UK because it's super difficult.

- Were you the first one in your family to go to school in the UK?

- I'm the first in my family to go to school. To go to university. So yeah, I'm the first in my whole extended family to go to uni.

- Wow.

- Yeah. And you know, you can imagine the kind of culture and social circles that you have, where if, you know, you're the only person who's gone to getting into that world. But even my friends. My friends weren't kind of the same mindset. So my friends were university people, you know, they studied, they were educated. And they're the ones who were telling me it ain't gonna happen, like don't waste your time applying to the UK because you can't. You will not be able to find a job. And this really fired me up, you know. When people started talking like this, it really kind of burnt that thing inside me like, I really wanna make it happen. And I was like, "yeah, well, okay, I'll see how it goes." But in my mind, I was like, "I'm going to make this happen no matter what." And so I applied to study here and got the visa and we actually went through some different steps to be able to afford, you know, because my family comes from, you know, working class. So we kind of sold our car and borrowed some money so I was able to study here.

- What did your parents think of this? Where they encouraging, supportive?

- Yeah luckily. Actually, you know, they did most of the legwork on this. So because first of all, I was reluctant to apply to even travel. You know, I was like, "yeah, maybe I could try my luck working here." But we all knew the chances were slim in being able to find an industry job and have, you know, have a decent sort of career in business or anything in that economy. So... and they were like the best option maybe is to go abroad. And we realized that there needs to be a certain sum of money that we have to pay for university. So they were like, "yeah, we're going to sell the car." And my dad's friend pitched in to help us out as well. So my dad went to talk to him and they helped us out with the accounting and the money and things like that so I can do the paperwork. And yeah, you know, they did a lot of work and they were always supportive. My parents they were always encouraging to this because they knew there is a better future out there. And I'm so grateful for that. And yeah, that's how it happened and I ended up coming here and I started my master's degree here.

- So you studied undergrad in your home country and then did a master's here?

- Correct, yeah.

- Gotcha. And what was your undergrad and then what was your master's in?

- So undergrad was computer engineering and post-grad was computer systems engineering. They sound quite similar but the modules here, modules means courses like the specific courses in the program, they were more about systems engineering in general not specifically computing which was really interesting. It was a really good experience. But I realized everything that I've learned in uni was not quite the same as you would see in the real world, you know. When you get in industry, it becomes a different ball game. But it was overall a really good experience.

- And did you apply to multiple schools or just one school? Or how did that work for the masters?

- Yeah, when I was there actually, I sat like nights on end, you know, doing research because like right now you get these educational consultants and companies, you know, they say, "hey, apply to the UK. We're gonna help you through this process." I didn't know anyone back then. I didn't know these things existed and I didn't have any relatives or people I knew here in the UK. So I was like, "you know, this is on me and I'm gonna do it by my own." And I started...and I went to work on that. So online, just doing research, finding universities, what are the best universities, for example, or like the most affordable unis in London. So I went to a few university fairs in Lebanon and I got some names and then I started firing off emails to them really. So yeah, I shortlisted like four or three universities and I got two offers and I accepted one, obviously.

- And so, like, I guess you accepted this to go to and go to university and it's now like you have no idea if there's gonna be a job at the end of it, right?

- This is a really good one because this is actually something I'm experiencing with my students right now. You know, I'm trying to tell my niche, "hey guys, you need to be thinking about the future, "your barrier." But if I go back to me at that time, I was like, I'm not thinking about like one year from now I'm just thinking about the next step. And I didn't know what's out there for me, but I just knew that I really need to get out of this environment and be in that environment so bad. And I knew everything's gonna be okay. You know, things are going to open. It's like you're in a video game and you're just thinking about your next achievement you know, and how it unlocks the next. And hat was it really for me.

- So, so yes. Cause I was curious of like, you're like, "okay, I wanna get a job in the UK. "To get a job in the UK, I just have to go through "and get some degree in the UK to be able to do that." Like, it's almost like a box that has to be checked or like, was that the way you were thinking about it? Or were you like genuinely interested in the program like for its own sake and learning the content and stuff?

- Right. Yeah. I see what you mean. Typically, I mean, why does anyone go for university, right? It's like your career prospects. And to me, the end goal was always the job, like finding a better career and a better job. And the university degree was the door to that.

- The stepping stone.

- Yeah, it was the stepping stone that's gonna open up the door for that career. And that's why most international students decide to study in the UK to get that international work experience. It's all about the career.

- So even though you had that attitude when you actually came to it and you're doing the school and the classes you were...even though you had that desire, you knew that was the in-state. It sounds like you were still more focused in the short term about the next achievement getting, good grades in the classes, is that fair?

- Yes. I think every step of the way I was always focused on the now.

- Yeah.

- Because it was an intense transition to go through, you know?

- It's a lot. There's so many things that are changing.

- Yeah. New environment, new people, away from your family, away from your friends. So there was a lot going on.

- New language too or did you already know English well?

- I already knew English well which was a really good advantage. And this really helped with my motivation. And I would say this is probably one of the major things that helped me continue because at many points I thought I wanna give up. It was so tough for me. You know, because like working full time, studying full time, doing night shifts in a hotel.

- You were working during the time too?

- Yeah. So working night shift and in the day you gotta do your homework for university and you gotta do research and find it and apply for a job for an industry job as well, because you have a limited amount of time. Your visa is gonna expire at this point in time. If you don't find a job before then, you're going to be up. So there was a lot of pressure. And to me, just being... feeling like the UK is a place that I really belonged was one of the main things that kept me motivated and kind of kept me pushing forth.

- That's amazing. So, yeah. So it's like, there was so much on your plate that even though you knew that really the main priority was to get that job after school, you just didn't have bandwidth to like focus on that from day one.

- I wouldn't say. Yeah. I would say definitely not man because... And there was even more than that, you know. There was like breakups, relationship issues, work, studies. So there was a lot. So you're always thinking about how can I get out of this hole that I'm in right now so I can look at the next steps?

- How, like, how did you, what like motivates you to keep pushing through all that?

- I would say my family. My family because they went through so much trouble to help me get here. And I was like, if I'm gonna give up and throw all this away, it's not gonna be good, you know? It's like throwing all that effort away. My dad is the type of person who really goes to work. You know, he's a builder and painter and he used to go to work like 12, 14 hours a day to make that small amount of money to help us out. And my mom was a working mom as well. So my family went through so much trouble and I have two younger brothers. So they, everyone in the family looks up to me. You know, I was the first person who goes to uni, first person to go out of the country. We had never traveled outside of Lebanon before. So there was a lot at stake for me. And I was like, "I'm not gonna be able to throw all this away. "If I'm gonna give up on myself, "I'm not gonna give up on my family."

- Wow. Wow. That's amazing. So what was the experience like for you getting your first job?

- So it was... it was never what I expected man. Like so a lot of people who study something, you know, I studied computer engineering. I was always thinking, you know, "after my degree, I wanna work as a computer engineer "or like a software engineer." But it was never like this. It was... I realized that you have to start somewhere and it's not gonna be your dream place. And getting my first tech job was in QA testing. So I started doing some manual testing on a website and it was a two weeks contract. I didn't know where that was going. But I really headed off with the manager. And he was like, "if you do well in these two weeks, we're gonna discuss further steps." And I was like, and that's, you know, to your point, focusing on the now. Even when you get the first job, it's really important to focus on where you are right now. So I was like, "these two weeks are gonna change the whole future for me." And I focused on making sure that I do my best during these two weeks. And those two weeks turned into one month and then the one month turned into three months and then three months into one year and then one year into two years. So I ended up working with the university for two years and that's where I ended being a software engineer. So that was really the journey until I got to that point.

- That's amazing. So why did you decide to like start helping other engineers and computing students versus just keep going as a software engineer?

- So, I think going through everything that I went through here in the UK, you know, I mentioned to you, I've been through a lot of different diverse, you know, kind of tough times, I would say. And going out of that, I got a nice job, you know, and I had some really good progression in terms of my career and tech industry, but I always, I was always thinking there's something out there, you know, there's more to this. And this wasn't a long time ago. This wasn't like 10 years ago. This was like these last few years. So when I started working and going to work I was always thinking there must be something out there. And that's when I started looking into business, you know? And I started seeing other people who are doing consulting and how you could actually scale your consulting business to make, you know, six figures, seven figures, 20 million a year. And I figured, okay, I can't be a software engineer forever, and I can't really make 20 million but if I look into the business route, that's, what's going to help me build that future for myself because my dream has always been financial freedom. And so I figured, okay, business is the way. And that's where my journey started looking into consulting and building my own business.

- Awesome. So let's go back to the beginning. Like how was things going in the consulting business before we were working together?

- Yeah. So before we were working together, I had, you know, I had decided, okay, I wanna work with international students and I wanna help them. And I've already had a couple of clients. But it felt so kind of watered down, you know, like, okay, the clients that I'm working with, am I working with MBA students to help them find jobs? Or am I working with like completely desperate people who are running out of time just to help them kind of you know, find any sort of work experience? And it was, I didn't really know where things were going, you know? I knew I needed help and I knew I needed to do something about my situation because it wasn't a very comfortable place to be in in your business. Because I imagined, I always imagined, like if I have two clients, I'd be over the moon. But testing my emotions, I was like, you know, this isn't how it's supposed to feel.

- How did it feel?

- I knew I needed clarity, you know? I felt like these aren't really the types of clients that I wanna work with.

- So it felt confusing at the time?

- Yeah.

- Lack of clarity?

- Yeah. So there was confusion because there were so many questions going in my head, right? Should I continue doing what I do? Or should I focus on the tech? Should I focus on STEM? Should I focus on this group of people? How can I find, you know, the right person and the people that I dream to work with? That I really enjoy working with, you know? The people I looked forward to, to get on the call with. So yeah, there was a lot of questions and a lot of decision fatigue as well. I wasn't able to make a decision and say, this is it and this is how I'm gonna do it. Let's just start the work.

- So what do you think was there like one particular job or objective you had at the front of your mind, you're like, I've gotta knock this down? Or did you not even have that? Like there was not a clarity on what was the next step for you?

- Yeah. It was always kinda like, I just wanna close a client, you know? I just wanna get that extra client or something like this. Well, the overall goal was to scale the business, yes. But to me, I was just like, you know, like numb down. Like if you're living numb and just knowing that oxygen is going into your body, I felt like that was the case in my business, just kind of carrying things on and on. Not really making a decision or something but just hoping that your next client pops out of nowhere. Yeah.

- So yeah. So getting the next client was the next job or goal? How were you trying to get the next client at the time?

- I was trying different things, you know. Doing value content, a little bit here, doing some outreach on LinkedIn, live videos and sending messages to people on Facebook and things like that. So doing different things.

- What was frustrating at the time about your progress or lack of progress?

- It felt like a lot of work. I felt like I'm booking calls in calendar, you know, I'm talking to people, but nothing is happening. You know, I'm booking these quick chats in calendar, but no strategy sessions and you're not having like those meaningful conversations with people that you can actually connect with. You know, smart people, intelligent people that you feel okay, this is the kind of person I really wanna work with. And so to me, I felt like I'm just running in circles and working, working, talking, talking, talking and talking my lungs out sometimes. And there isn't this great return on investment.

- Yeah. It reminds me of I think about sometimes I call it like spaghetti marketing. Have I told you that idea?

- Yeah.

- Where you're just like throwing spaghetti at the wall and you're just throwing more and more and you're just hoping something sticks, but you'd have no idea why it would or not.

- Yeah. Yeah, it's like taking steps in the dark, you know. Like maybe this works, this works. Yeah.

- And the other thing that comes to mind is like you ever heard the saying, like to white knuckle something?

- No.

- White knuckle is like, when you clinch your fist, your knuckles get wider, right? And so it's like, you're just white knuckling it meaning like, you're just gripping it so hard, you're hoping that it's gonna work. But it's like, that's not the way to do it.

- So specific and brilliant. Like I've never heard this before.

- Yeah. So if someone says, "oh, you're white knuckling it" it's like, you're, you're too intense. You're too trying to control everything and grip it tightly. And it's like, you need to relax. And just, you know.

- And this is the very accurate description of my situation at the time, you know. Because I felt like just banging my head against the wall. And I knew it doesn't have to be this hard man. Like, there is some way out there where I can go out and talk to people and close clients and I knew there's an easier way. But yeah, it just felt like too much, too much pressure.

- So where did you first hear about us or me?

- So we kinda, we connected on one of the consulting groups and, and yeah I think you commented on some of my posts I just found myself in a messenger chat with you. We were kinda chatting about things and talking about like the business and goals and things like that. And yeah, that's how it started.

- And with that, like what peaked your interest?

- I think I was looking for someone who is more successful than I am. You know, I looked at your profile and things that you were doing, you were doing some really awesome work with, you know, other coaches and consultants. And you had that way to... and it was different, it was refreshing than what was out there. Because you weren't doing like a whole bunch of videos or posts on your profile. You just had those interviews and you were showing your results at the same time as well. And that's really the combination that peaked my interest.

- Cool. So, what... looking back at the last 30 days, what did we do together? What were some of the big things that really, you feel like has helped you a lot?

- I think the biggest thing that we achieved throughout this time was the clarity. You know, getting clarity on my niche, really honing down on the people that I wanna target and the people I feel comfortable working with and the people I can help as well. So being able to make that decision, it's like taking off 80% of the pressure.

- 'Cause all these questions in your head, it really consumes your time and you're not able to make progress in any one direction. Yeah.

- It's like all those questions you had, it sounds like, well I helped you answer them. And it's not like I told you what you need to do all the time, it's just like we talked through it and I kind of gave you permission to like, just like stop engaging all those questions and just like take action and focus.

- Yeah. It's like therapy, you know. It's like the therapist doesn't really tell you, "this is what you need to do." But it's like they open the door for you to see, okay, this is how you can actually do it and this is the possibility. And being able to work through this and bounce ideas off of you and in the group and getting that support because when you have these questions, oh, should I do this? Should I do that? But if you go and ask a question and you know, someone who's successful and really making those results and really making those strategy sessions, because that's really inspiring to me. You know, to see someone making that amount of revenue and that amount, that number of strategy sessions organically. And I'm like, yeah, this is the future for me. You know, this is possible for me. So if I get that answer from you, this means, okay, there must be something that I could do better right now. And, and that's, you know, when you set... set a decision, like make a decision, okay, this is the right way forward or this is what I'm gonna focus on moving forward. And that's it. And you make the next decision.

- What about, so let's dig into this more clarity. So like, what about, I think one of the things was you got a lot clear on your niche and your offer structure. Can we talk through some about that?

- Absolutely. So, you know, because as I mentioned, initially my niche was like international students and I wasn't really sure, okay should I focus on computing? Should I focus on Middle Eastern students? Or like students coming from a certain country? And I wasn't really sure I was dabbling around all of these different niches. And working together, I realized, okay that we can actually focus on this specific group of students. You know, the type of... the group of people who we can actually help with most confidence and deliver the most value to them. And getting that clarity on those people has opened the door for everything else, you know?

- Wasn't there something about, so you got, you got a new message down and you posted on your wall and then all these people started messaging you?

- Yeah.

- Yeah. So, you know, when you update your bio on Facebook, I was really excited after we worked together on that. And we kind of pinned down this message in this new niche. I was feeling really excited, you know? It's a new offer, new niche, updated my bio in a post and it kind of gets shared on my profile and people have already started asking questions. You know, how can I find a job in this? And how can I do that? And that was really, yeah, that was really exciting.

- And like, so when that happened, I mean, you probably knew intellectually that that was possible, but what did it feel like to actually like see it firsthand and be like, ah, okay. Like.

- Yeah, I knew, I always knew like, maybe this is where it should be. But I never, I don't know something was holding me back to actually do it, you know? And when I did this, I posted about this, I started seeing those people and I was like, these people have been always in front of me, but they just needed that sign. You know, that thing from me to allow them to kind of levitate towards me and just ask these questions. So it felt like you're opening up and you sort of, it's like a new ocean, you know? It's like open up new potential for you.

- Yup. Okay, so that's kind of the niche in the message. And then the offer structure. You know, we went back and forth a lot about like, what does that look like? Can you share a little bit more about that process at a high level?

- Yeah. So we did a lot of iterations on the offer because initially I kind of had an offer which has like a sales overview, you know, and a whole bunch of steps and a whole bunch of things that you need to do. So I was actually confusing myself with that to be honest before because I had so many things that I needed to go through. But working together on that, it just became quite clear for me the process that I need to go through for myself and take my prospects through it. And you know, the different elements that you need to have in your offer or your sales process even. So you're clear yourself and you are actually delivering it, you know, in a way that makes sense. And this is where building the offer in a way that's kind of similar to titles of weeks in a training course. This made a lot of sense to me. And it really simplified things for me. And this is how we kind of build those five steps.

- It's not like, we're like, "okay, this offer is gonna like convince people "or trick them into working with us. "Or like it's going to hit the right note." It's like literally thinking through the offer made you more clear on what you were doing.

- Yeah. Its not gimmicks, you know. No, absolutely. Yeah, this is not a thing because like, in some certain cases, like some gurus or some coaches are going to be like, "hey, let's pimp up your offer you know."

- Let's... That's gotta make it more buzzy and just more attractive. But that's not really... That wasn't what I was expecting to get out of the work together because I knew what kind of person you were. And we were kind of working on the exact offer, what sort of value does it have? And how aligned is it with the truth? that was really...

- Right, it wasn't about adding sizzle. It's like, how can we add more meat?

- Yeah. It was just being more aligned with the truth and make it most valuable to the people that we're trying to help.

- What do you think like, so we got a better kind of niche and message statement, can you speak to how you see the niche and the message? How does that interact with the offer? And why is it important to have like a really good niche and message first before you like map through the offer?

- So...

- Did you understand the question?

- Sorry.

- Does the question makes sense?

- Yeah, maybe just repeat it because I kinda zoned out a little bit.

- Okay.

- Just so I make sure I have the right question.

- Yeah so we got clear on the niche and the message first and then the offer and looking back on that process, like why was it so important to get really clear on the niche and the really powerful message before going through the recipe of the offer, the structure of the offer, the process of the offer?

- It's super important because this is like getting ahead of yourself. You know, you can't really travel into the future or like skip steps in the process. It's a step-by-step process because defining your niche is actually gonna define what sort of offer you have for them, right? If I'm gonna talk about international students and then give them an offer that's tailored for computing students, no one is gonna be interested in that and they're gonna be looking at me like what is he talking about? So defining the message first is everything. You know, it kind of opens the door to everything that you're gonna do next. Even your sales processes as well.

- Yeah. It's like the message is kinda like where you're going, it's the goal. And that's like, if you don't know where you're going, you can't build the roadmap to get there. And the roadmap's the offer.

- Yeah, yeah.

- You can, but you're not gonna get a good outcome. Like people, that's where I think some people trip up.

- Yeah, some people maybe think, "oh, I just need to work on this part of my offer, "no need to think to worry about that, "I've already defined this." But there's not enough enough times that you can iterate on your message. And it always starts with the message and the niche and the market. You know, you can't improve that enough. And every time you do this work here, you really wanna go and tailor the offer even further to that niche.

- Yep. So then, okay, so we did that, we got the offer and then what was next? What did you do next?

- I think next was acquisition, you know. The way that you kind of convert those.... Or like taking it to market, I would say. You know, taking this whole thing to market and shipping this whole thing, because before I also have a lot of questions about, you know, just sending outreach and reaching out to people and having these awkward conversations.

- I remember you had a lot of doubt around like, oh, I like, you like, you look at all their profiles to see if they're a fit before you even like engage with them. Tell us more about that.

- Yeah. So a lot of the times when I go out and try and prospect people, I'm like, "ah, getting messages from people" and I'm like, "ah, I don't know if I can help this person. "They're not a good fit. "And they're asking me some questions and you know, "this is not the type of person I want to work with." And I had a lot of frustration in that and equally the effort involved in starting conversations with some people and them just responding yes or no questions that was really awkward as well. So yeah, there was a lot of frustration and confusion in the initial acquisition.

- And so what changed with lead gen?

- So with lead gen, two things I think changed. So first of all, getting the clarity on the way you position the conversations with your prospects is super important And like, knowing that there is a structure to this, and it's not a random process, and it's not like, you know, a work of magic or sorcery is very important because there is actually a structure and a way for you to build those conversations with your prospects. So you can really stop wasting time on those like people who respond yes or no and why is this person talking to me? So you really wanted to... I really wanted to eliminate that. And that was really what I was able to achieve. And then the second thing is this very structure that we followed, it kind of helped me open up unlimited potential because people who I thought were not a good fit joining into that conversation and following that structure of the work, people started talking about things, which I was like, "yeah, you know, you..." "this is the kind of person I'm looking for. "Yes, definitely we can help you. "Let's hop on a call, you know?" So I started taking the conversations into completely different direction, which was really good.

- Yeah. That was when you started messaging me and you're like, "this person, you know, tells me that they want to do X. "They're studying like electrical engineering or something like that." And you had no idea. And it's like these just more and more people that you were writing off historically, like, as you built a relationship with them, they would share more and divulge in that you're like, "oh wow, this person's actually a really good fit."

- Yeah. Yeah, it's drilling into the conversation. But I would actually take it even a step further and say everything that you do like from defining your message and really getting clear on that, on your profile, on your presence, on your social media, it really starts driving those kinds of people towards you. Like right now, I get people coming from a medical background and I'm like, "hey man, yeah. "So what can I help you with?" And you know, "how can I help?" And they'd start saying, "oh yeah, you know, and I have some interest in IT and I was thinking maybe I could study something related but I don't know what to do." And I was like, "yes. "Definitely. I can give you some advice." And, you know, so it starts bringing out in people, the things that, you know, that they could, you could bond with them in terms of your business and the things that you can help them with.

- So what is, okay, so what are some of the metrics you've had? You've only been doing this lead generation for like a week or two. Like we did a lot of this prep work beforehand. You've gotten like what, like 30 conversations in messenger so far?

- Yeah, yeah, I would say so. I've been having a lot of conversations but I think, you know, in the window of these two weeks in terms of the stuff that we did and in terms of the niche that we decided to hone down on, maybe around 30 conversations with ICP, so ideal client personas. You know, people who are really matching to the perfect buyer or dream buyer profile. And out of those, we had about 12 quality quick chat calls and from this about five strategy sessions.

- Nice. So what, like, what is this, like these changes in how you've being seeing how to engage with people and converse with them? What has that meant for your mindset? Like, has it just changed how you look at the world and like the opportunity in front of you?

- Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, everything is paradigm, you know? And doing these things and just, it's like playing around with it, you know? It's like testing the market and fiddling around with this new offer and testing it and shipping it out there. So, doing all this, it kind of helps you explore what sort of options and what sort of potential is out there. And some of these conversations, you know, the example that you mentioned and these other conversations that I'm having, I started to realize that what you see might not be what's everything out there, you know? If you look at it from a way that, you know, building that relationship with the clients and maybe turning them into perfect clients, you're basically sitting on a goldmine, you know? You have an unlimited supply ideal client personas.

- Let's dig into that for a second 'cause it's, I find a lot of people, they have this mentality of like, "oh, that person's not a fit" or, "oh, they're not gonna work with me." And they... Yeah, they're like in the habit of judging really prematurely if they're going to be a fit or not. And I think it's so interesting what you just said, turning people into ideal clients. And I don't know 'cause we've talked about this together and I think about it in the same way. And I don't know if it's literally that you turn them into an ideal client or that when you're on the quick chat, you just uncover that they were because you're open-minded to it. But in the moment it feels like you're literally turning people into ideal clients for you. Like you're creating opportunity in front of your eyes. And it's like the most powerful feeling. It's so exciting.

- Yeah. That is a really good point. Because when I say turning into an ideal client, you're not changing something about them. You know, you're not changing their situation and where they come from and their goals. But actually, you're changing the way you look at the situation or the way you look at them and your perception of them. That's what changing. So they're turning into an ideal client in your head and I can't tell you how many times it happens so far. Like I get on a call and not making so much of it, and I'm like, "yeah, you know, I'm just gonna have a chat "with this person, I don't know what's gonna happen. "I'm not really sure if they're a good fit." And then we start talking and then they spit out all these things about themselves. And I'm like, "Jesus." And I got very this close to rescheduling the call or like canceling it and I'm saying to myself, "I can't believe I almost canceled this call."

- That's amazing. So what do you think, like what areas of your business and life have improved so far?

- Okay. So business-wise so far, I have that clarity on my business, on my niche, the people I wanna target, the people who I wanna help and really the vision for the future. So, you know, knowing what kind of targets you wanna put for yourself and having that vision for the near future. This is really valuable. And, you know, if you don't have that, you will be depressed, basically. At least for me, because I don't like uncertainty, I hate uncertainty, you know? And when I have uncertainty in my life, I get depressed. And so getting that clarity and knowing where I'm headed and really seeing the results in the community as well, and the results that you're posting in your own business, it's definitely an inspiration for me and keeps me kind of thinking forward. This is what I can achieve for myself. And this is the mindset side. So, you know, the business side yeah, message improved, offer improved, this is great. In terms of life, having that clarity and having that peace of mind, okay. that this is actually possible for me. And hopefully in the next three to six months, I could be making like, you know, three closes a month or at least one client every single month. That's consistent income in the business. So I'm actually able to quit my job and go full-time on the business. This is really my dream, you know? If you're gonna talk about life improvements, someone working on their dream is really the best thing that you could think about.

- That's awesome. So why do you think things have improved in those ways?

- Why? Because we did the work, I would say. You know, we went and we did the work together. And we set clear goals and we worked on them and we iterated on them.

- So going back to our sales conversation, why did you decide to do business with me?

- With you is because the conversation, it wasn't a sales call. You know, it was... It wasn't a sales call. Because basically I had bought before the sales call. And maybe it's because of the type of buyer I am but also because of the way you conducted the call. You have already closed me before we got on the conversation. Because I was looking for someone who could be an inspiration and who is successful in doing those results for themselves and who could help me in my business. And when we got on the call, you actually confirmed that to me. And you confirmed that you are the type of person I wanna work with because you weren't even trying to sell me. You just built that action plan for me that, okay, this is what we're gonna do and this is how you can do it. And these are the goals that you wanna achieve. That's the action plan and that's how we're gonna do it.

- Nice. Nice. And so was there anything in that conversation that at the end, like really kicked you over the fence? Like got you to say yes right then and there?

- I think it was more of a personal thing to me. Because I like to work with people with the same mindset, you know? People who share the same sort of interest or background or journey. And the fact that you come from a technical and technology background, And the fact that you, you know, did some boot camps you got in software and did some work with e-commerce startups and things like that, these are all things which I felt like, okay, we have a cultural fit. Because I, you know, although you, you know, in growing your business, you're looking for a tactical fit, someone who could help you get the results, but also I wanted to get a cultural fit as well from the relationship. Because it's equally these two things.

- There was something else you also told me. Do you remember what I'm referring to? You said you wanted to work with an American. Tell me more about that. Why was that?

- So that's even more personal because I like American people, you know? In general. I grew up with Americans, right? So, you know, in that environment, so, you know, in the environment that I come from, really humble environment, you know. Poor beginnings or, you know, really humble beginnings. And we didn't have so much going on in our lives, you know? We lived in a basement house, very small house. My dad is a working person. My mom is a housewife with three kids. So that kind of environment and then our American friends, they came into the picture and they were these like cool people. They were like the coolest thing that we've ever seen, you know? They brought these toys and these gadgets and the trips that we used to have together. So I grew really really fond of their culture and the way they lived life. And since then, you know, I basically grew up with them and I spoke in English before I had spoken Arabic really well. So I grew really passionate about Americans and American culture in general. So yeah, that's why I like the culture and I like the people.

- That's awesome. Cool. So would you recommend others work with me?

- Yeah absolutely. Definitely. If you, you know, if they want to really get that clarity and that structure, in the work and work with someone, you know, who's like really on point, you know. I like the fact that you are direct and you're efficient. That's what I really like, you know? Where we're really efficient because, you know, there's no wasting time and just like joking about and beating around the bush, we're always on point together. And if, you know, if someone wants that sort of work and they want to see the results and that have that motivation by working with someone. So I definitely recommend working with you.

- Nice. So what type of coaches or consultants do you think we're a good fit for?

- In terms of your business?

- Mhhh.

- Yeah. I think people who are getting started and they don't know what's out there for them, because there's so much noise in this niche, you know? There's so much going on, people telling you, "yeah, do Facebook ads, yeah do this, "yeah do value content" you know and just being able to see someone who's doing really well organically, it just kinda tells you, okay, maybe it's not just about the technology and the tactics, you know, and the things that you do and like these gimmicks and how you can trick people into coming on your page and collecting leads and things like that. It's really about having a strong offer, having a way to connect with people. This is all about humans. You know, you're trying to sell to humans. And if you are the kind of coach and person who believes in the human connection, then that's definitely, you know, you are in the right place to work with you.

- So, if someone like that is listening, if anyone's listening right now and they're on the fence, why should they take action right now?

- I would say they should take action because as an entrepreneur, you definitely don't wanna be that entrepreneur who mulls shit over, you know? You remember when we had the salesforce, you pitched the price. I was like, it's done. You know, it was, I didn't haggle on the price. I didn't talk about like, yeah, I need to think about it, or I need to get back to you. I just made the decision then and there. Because if you wanna get results, you wanna move quick on them. The world is moving really fast and really quick especially in these digital times. And you don't wanna be that person who, you know, say "yeah, I'm gonna think about it." Because whatever happens, if you make the decision quickly, you better make like a not perfect decision, rather than not making a decision at all. So people should act right now. And you know, honestly, maybe now you have the time to work with people but in the future, you know, things, you know, people might miss out on like getting that support and getting that hands-on approach. So, you know, wasting time, it doesn't help anyone, really.

- That's an interesting point. Like, I think a lot of people think that like, when you're doing B2B these types of relationship sales, they think that they're...they don't, it's not conscious, but subconsciously they think almost like they're buying like a shirt off the rack where the shirt's going to be there in three months, six months, nine months. But it's like, as my business evolves and your business evolves, like the deal that I present now, it's not necessarily gonna be there in a month or two months. And it's not... I'm not trying to be scarcity tactics, I'm not trying to trick anybody right now, it's just the truth.

- Yeah. So I've missed so many chances that I know too well, not to mull things over, you know? Right now you are offering your services at a certain price point. In the future, you're gonna have more people come on board. You're gonna want to scale your business, you wanna help more people. So they will probably have to pay more or they will probably need to take more efforts to be part of this. So, things are moving forward really quick. If you wanna start something, do it now.

- So, what is your number one piece of advice for coaches and consultants?

- I would say really, you know, don't mull things over. Again, you know, to the last point, don't spend too much time just trying with different things. Getting clarity on your business and on your goals is really crucial. And that's like an age old advice, really. You know, don't put effort in many different directions trying different things that you're not really sure that they're gonna work. But really look at something that actually works and work with someone who has done these things for themselves and take their advice and just implement it. You know, do the work, don't waste time because the world is moving quickly.

- Yep. So what I'm hearing is like getting clarity, focusing and doing basically fewer things but doing them better, much better.

- World-class.

- World-class.

- It's not about doing all bunch of things, but it's doing less things. Yeah, it's literally doing less things, man. Since we started...

- But doing them better

- Yeah, that's right. So doing less things but at a better quality and a better level and a better standard. Since we started working together, I feel so comfortable. Like it's not more work. It's less work. But the quality of the conversations is better. The quality of the process, the quality of the offer is better and the quality of the process is better. And so it's less work, but a better, a higher quality.

- So what do you think in the next, like week, the four weeks, what's next for you? What do you think is like gonna happen?

- So in the next week...

- Week to four weeks, like, what are your next objectives? Like what is right around the corner? Do you feel like you're gonna make a sale here in a minute?

- Yeah.

- So I feel I'm close to making a sale. And then new offer, you know? We're really close to positioning and just getting, you know, just today I got off a really good strategy session and we have a thumbs up thumbs down call booked. So yeah, I feel really getting close to getting that dream buyer to buy. And it's going to be different than before. Because if I have one dream buyer this month, the next month is gonna be, you know, much better than the previous month. So yeah, maybe making a close or two on a dream buyer, this would be the next milestone.

- Let's make it can happen man.

- Yeah.

- Let's do it. So people wanna learn more about you, where can they find out more about you online?

- Absolutely. So they can go to jawadsabra.com or my Facebook, Jawad S. as well. LinkedIn. Yeah and everything is on my Facebook profile. They can learn about what I do and see all about my content and the way we help people as well.

- Awesome Jawad. Well, thank you so much for your time man. And again, like, it's been such a pleasure working with you. I'm really having fun and yeah I'm just so excited for you and I can't wait to see what happens next.

- Thanks man. Likewise, and really good talking to you. And I really enjoyed this conversation as well.

- Likewise. All right. Bye everybody. Thanks.
